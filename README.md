Computational Analysis of Religious and Ideological Linguistic Behavior

The UVa Initiative on Conflict, Politics, and Religion has developed a 1-9 lingusitic rigidity scale, which measures an ideolgical or religious group's use of language.

Currently, the Initiative on Conflict, Politics, and Religion has a manual process to score raw text, on a scale of 1-9. This project seeks to automate this process.

Once automated, the goal is to be able to analyze how an ideological group's use of language changes over time and what that may predict about a group's behavior.
