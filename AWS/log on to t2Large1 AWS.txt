#####################
## THE INITIAL SETUP 
#####################

## do all this to make sure you have python 2.7 setup with dev-tools etc.
# http://www.lecloud.net/post/61401763496/install-update-to-python-27-and-latest-pip-on

## then install Anaconda, but downloading the Linux 64-bit Python 2.7 installer from here:
# https://www.continuum.io/downloads
## and then running this command (on your computer terminal, not AWS) to upload it 
scp -i AWS/DSI-Religion-t2Large1.pem.txt {path to file you downloaded}/Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh ec2-user@52.87.228.121:~/
#scp -i AWS/DSI-Religion-t2Large1.pem.txt /Users/Seth/Downloads/Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh ec2-user@52.87.228.121:~/

## then upload the environment file (for later use)
scp -i AWS/DSI-Religion-t2Large1.pem.txt admin/py27env.yml ec2-user@52.87.228.121:~/

## then go to AWS and run this to run the installer
bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh 

## (then it tells you to log off and open a new terminal window, so you do, and then log back on) then...

conda env create -f py27env.yml
