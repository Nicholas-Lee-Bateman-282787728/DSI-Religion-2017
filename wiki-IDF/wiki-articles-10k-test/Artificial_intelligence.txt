 "AI" redirects here. For other uses of "AI" and "Artificial intelligence", see Ai (disambiguation). Artificial intelligence (or AI) is both the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science which aims to create it. Major AI textbooks define artificial intelligence as "the study and design of intelligent agents," (who use the term "computational intelligence" as a synonym for artificial intelligence). Other textbooks that define AI this way include , and  (who prefer the term "rational agent") and write "The whole-agent view is now widely accepted in the field"  where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.This definition, in terms of goals, actions, perception and environment, is due to . Other definitions also include knowledge and learning as additional components. AI can be seen as a realization of an abstract intelligent agent (AIA) which exhibits the functional essence of intelligence.Abstract Intelligent Agents: Paradigms, Foundations and Conceptualization Problems, A.M. Gadomski, J.M. Zytkow, in "Abstract Intelligent Agent, 2".  Printed by ENEA, Rome 1995, ISSN/1120-558X] John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956,Although there is some controversy on this point (see ), McCarthy states unequivocally "I came up with the term" in a c|net interview. (See Getting Machines to Think Like Us.) defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."See John McCarthy, What is Artificial Intelligence? Among the traits that researchers hope machines will exhibit are reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: , ,  and . General intelligence (or "strong AI") has not yet been achieved and is a long-term goal of AI research. General intelligence (strong AI) is discussed by popular introductions to AI, such as: , ,  AI research uses tools and insights from many fields, including computer science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, ontology, operations research, economics, control theory, probability, optimization and logic. AI research also overlaps with tasks such as robotics, control systems, scheduling, data mining, logistics, speech recognition, facial recognition and many others.See AI Topics: applications Other names for the field have been proposed, such as computational intelligence, synthetic intelligence, intelligent systems,The name of the journal Intelligent Systems or computational rationality. Humanity has imagined in great detail the implications of thinking machines or artificial beings. They appear in Greek myths, such as Talos of Crete, the golden robots of Hephaestus and Pygmalion's Galatea.,  The earliest known humanoid robots (or  automatons) were sacred statues worshipped in Egypt and Greece, believed to have been endowed with genuine consciousness by craftsman.The Egyptian statue of Amun is discussed by .  discusses Greek statues.  Hermes Trismegistus expressed the common belief that with these statues, craftsman had reproduced "the true nature of the gods", their sensus and spiritus. McCorduck makes the connection between sacred automatons and Mosaic law (developed around the same time), which expressly forbids the worship of robots. In medieval times, alchemists such as Paracelsus claimed to have created artificial beings. (Paracelsus) Realistic clockwork imitations of human beings have been built by people such as Yan Shi, Hero of Alexandria, Al-JazariA Thirteenth Century Programmable Robot and Wolfgang von Kempelen. Pamela McCorduck observes that "artificial intelligence in one form or another is an idea that has pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized." In modern fiction, beginning with Mary Shelley's classic Frankenstein, writers have explored the ethical issues presented by thinking machines. discusses Frankenstein and identifies the key ethical issues as scientific hubris and the suffering of the monster, e.g. robot rights. If a machine can be created that has intelligence, can it also feel?  If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human being? This is a key issue in Frankenstein as well as in modern science fiction: for example, the film Artificial Intelligence: A.I. considers a machine in the form of a small boy which has been given the ability to feel human emotions, including, tragically, the capacity to suffer. This issue is also being considered by futurists, such as California's Institute for the Future under the name "robot rights",Robots could demand legal rights although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.See the Times Online, Human rights for robots? We’re getting carried awayrobot rights:  Science fiction writers and futurists have also speculated on the technology's potential impact on humanity. In fiction, AI has appeared as a servant (R2D2), a comrade (Lt. Commander Data), an extension to human abilities (Ghost in the Shell), a conqueror (The Matrix), a dictator (With Folded Hands) and an exterminator (Terminator, Battlestar Galactica). Some realistic potential consequences of AI are decreased labor demand,  the enhancement of human ability or experience, and a need for redefinition of human identity and basic values.Joseph Weizenbaum (the AI researcher who developed the first chatterbot program, ELIZA) argued in 1976 that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life. Weizenbaum: , ,  and  Futurists estimate the capabilities of machines using Moore's Law, which measures the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology with uncanny accuracy. Ray Kurzweil has calculated that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and that by 2040 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past, a scenario that science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named the "technological singularity".Singularity, transhumanism: ,  "Artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution," Edward Fredkin said in the 1980s,Quoted in  expressing an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's Darwin Among the Machines (1863), and expanded upon by George Dyson (science historian) in his book of the same name (1998). Several futurists and science fiction writers have predicted that human beings and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger, is now associated with robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and Ray Kurzweil. Transhumanism has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example on the manga Ghost in the Shell. In the middle of the 20th century, a handful of scientists began a new approach to building intelligent machines, based on recent discoveries in neurology, a new mathematical theory of information, an understanding of control and stability called cybernetics, and above all, by the invention of the digital computer, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning.Among the researchers who laid the foundations of the theory of computation, cybernetics, information theory and neural networks were Claude Shannon, Norbert Weiner, Warren McCullough, Walter Pitts, Donald Hebb, Donald McKay, Alan Turing and John Von Neumann. , , , .  The field of modern AI research was founded at conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956.,  Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for many decades, especially John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, who founded AI laboratories at MIT, CMU and Stanford. They and their students wrote programs that were, to most people, simply astonishing:Russell and Norvig write "it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish."  computers were solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.,  and . The programs described are Daniel Bobrow's STUDENT, Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd's SHRDLU. By the middle 60s their research was heavily funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and they were optimistic about the future of the new field: These predictions, and many like them, would not come true. They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.See History of artificial intelligence — the problems. In 1974, in response to the criticism of England's Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from Congress to fund more productive projects, DARPA cut off all undirected, exploratory research in AI. This was the first AI Winter., ,  under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment." and also see Howe, J. "Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh University : a Perspective" In the early 80s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems; applying the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached more than a billion dollars. and and  Minsky and others warned the community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control and that disappointment was sure to follow. Beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, more lasting AI Winter began. In the 90s and early 21st century AI achieved its greatest successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence was adopted throughout the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and many other areas., under "Artificial Intelligence in the 90s" The success was due to several factors: the incredible power of computers today (see Moore's law), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and above all a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards. The philosophy of artificial intelligence considers the question "Can machines think?" Alan Turing, in his classic 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, was the first to try to answer it. In the years since, several answers have been given:All of these positions are mentioned in standard discussions of the subject, such as  and  While there is no universally accepted definition of intelligence,"We cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent." John McCarthy, Basic Questions AI researchers have studied several traits that are considered essential. Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the process of conscious, step-by-step reasoning that human beings use when they solve puzzles, play board games, or make logical deductions.Problem solving, puzzle solving, game playing and deduction: , , , . By the late 80s and 90s, AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.Uncertain reasoning: , , ,  For difficult problems, most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources — most experience a "combinatorial explosion": the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size. The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research.Intractability and efficiency and the combinatorial explosion:  It is not clear, however, that conscious human reasoning is any more efficient when faced with a difficult abstract problem. Cognitive scientists have demonstrated that human beings solve most of their problems using unconscious reasoning, rather than the conscious, step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. Several famous examples:  showed that people do poorly on completely abstract problems, but if the problem is restated to allowed the use of intuitive social intelligence, performance dramatically improves. (See Wason selection task)  have shown that people are terrible at elementary problems that involve uncertain reasoning. (See list of cognitive biases for several examples).  have controversially argued that even our skills at mathematics depend on knowledge and skills that come from "the body", i.e. sensorimotor and perceptual skills. (See Where Mathematics Comes From)  Embodied cognitive science argues that unconscious sensorimotor skills are essential to our problem solving abilities. It is hoped that sub-symbolic methods, like computational intelligence and situated AI, will be able to model these instinctive skills. The problem of unconscious problem solving, which forms part of our commonsense reasoning, is largely unsolved. Knowledge representationKnowledge representation: , , , ,  and knowledge engineeringKnowledge engineering: , ,  are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;Representing categories and relations: Semantic networks, description logics, inheritance (including frames and scripts): , , ,  situations, events, states and time;Representing events and time: Situation calculus, event calculus, fluent calculus (including solving the frame problem): , ,  causes and effects;Causal calculus:  knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);Representing knowledge about knowledge: Belief calculus, modal logics: ,  and many other, less well researched domains. A complete representation of "what exists" is an ontologyOntology:  (borrowing a word from traditional philosophy), of which the most general are called upper ontologies. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are: Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.Planning: , , , ,  They need a way to visualize the future: they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it. They must also attempt to determine the utility or "value" of the choices available to it.Information value theory:  In some planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of it's actions may be.Classical planning: , , ,  However, if this is not true, it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.Planning and acting in non-deterministic domains: conditional planning, execution monitoring, replanning and continuous planning:  Multi-agent planning tries to determine the best plan for a community of agents, using cooperation and competition to achieve a given goal. Emergent behavior such as this is used by both evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence.Multi-agent planning and emergent behavior:  Important machine learningLearning: , , , ,  problems are:  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. (These can be analyzed in terms decision theory, using concepts like utility). Natural language processingNatural language processing: , , ,  gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages human beings speak. Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own, by reading the existing text available over the internet. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval (or text mining) and machine translation. Applications of natural language processing, including information retrieval (i.e. text mining) and machine translation ,    The field of roboticsRobotics: , ,  is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulationMoving and configuration space:  and navigation, with sub-problems of localization (knowing where you are), mapping (learning what is around you) and motion planning (figuring out how to get there).Robotic mapping (localization, etc)   Machine perceptionMachine perception: ,  is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer visionComputer vision: , ,  is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are speech recognition,Speech recognition: ,  facial recognition and object recognition.Object recognition:    Emotion and social skills play two roles for an intelligent agent:,  Most researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence (known as strong AI), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them. A few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project. Many of the problems above are considered AI-complete: to solve one problem, you must solve them all. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like machine translation requires that the machine follow the author's argument (reason), know what it's talking about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author's intention (social intelligence). Machine translation, therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it. There are as many approaches to AI as there are AI researchers—any coarse categorization is likely to be unfair to someone. Artificial intelligence communities have grown up around particular problems, institutions and researchers, as well as the theoretical insights that define the approaches described below. Artificial intelligence is a young science and is still a fragmented collection of subfields. At present, there is no established unifying theory that links the subfields into a coherent whole. In the 40s and 50s, a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology, information theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton and the Ratio Club in England. Among the researchers who laid the foundations of cybernetics, information theory and neural networks were Claude Shannon, Norbert Weiner, Warren McCullough, Walter Pitts, Donald Hebb, Donald McKay, Alan Turing and John Von Neumann. , , .  When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: CMU, Stanford and MIT, and each one developed its own style of research. John Haugeland named these approaches to AI "good old fashioned AI" or "GOFAI". ,  See Science at Google Books, and McCarthy's presentation at AI@50  His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focussed on using formal logic to solve wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning. Work in logic led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming. . Neats vs. scruffies: .  and this still forms the basis of research into commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat's Cyc) which must be built one complicated concept at a time. During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background. The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of perceptrons by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert in 1969. See History of AI, AI winter, or Frank Rosenblatt. .  By the 1980s, however, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems. characterizes these newer approaches to AI as "sub-symbolic".  and  These and other sub-symbolic approaches, such as fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation, are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence. See IEEE Computational Intelligence Society  The "intelligent agent" paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s. "The whole-agent view is now widely accepted in the field" .  The intelligent agent paradigm is discussed in major AI textbooks, such as: , ,  Although earlier researchers had proposed modular "divide and conquer" approaches to AI, For example, both John Doyle  and Marvin Minsky's popular classic The Society of Mind  used the word "agent" to describe modular AI systems.  the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until Judea Pearl, Alan Newell and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of AI.  When the economist's definition of a rational agent was married to computer science's definition of an object or module, the intelligent agent paradigm was complete. An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximizes its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. The most complicated intelligent agents would be rational, thinking human beings. The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works — some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic neural networks and some can be based on new approaches (without forcing researchers to reject old approaches that have proven useful). The paradigm gives researchers a common language to describe problems and share their solutions with each other and with other fields—such as decision theory—that also use concepts of abstract agents. An agent architecture or cognitive architecture allows researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi-agent system. Agent architectures, hybrid intelligent systems, and multi-agent systems: ,  and  A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system, and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration. A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.Albus, J. S. 4-D/RCS reference model architecture for unmanned ground vehicles. In G Gerhart, R Gunderson, and C Shoemaker, editors, Proceedings of the SPIE AeroSense Session on Unmanned Ground Vehicle Technology, volume 3693, pages 11--20 Rodney Brooks' subsumption architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system. In the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below. Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:Search algorithms: , , ,  Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.Forward chaining, backward chaining, Horn clauses, and logical deduction as search: , , ,  Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal.State space search and planning: , ,  Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space. Even some learning algorithms have at their core a search engine. There are several types of search algorithms: Logic Logic: , , ,  was introduced into AI research by John McCarthy in his 1958 Advice Taker proposal. The most important technical development was J. Alan Robinson's discovery of the resolution and unification algorithm for logical deduction in 1963. This procedure is simple, complete and entirely algorithmic, and can easily be performed by digital computers. Resolution and unification: , , ,  However, a naive implementation of the algorithm quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion or an infinite loop. In 1974, Robert Kowalski suggested representing logical expressions as Horn clauses (statements in the form of rules: "if p then q"), which reduced logical deduction to backward chaining or forward chaining. This greatly alleviated (but did not eliminate) the problem. History of logic programming: . Advice Taker: , Logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning, Satplan: , ,  and inductive logic programming is a method for learning. Explanation based learning, relevance based learning, inductive logic programming, case based reasoning: , , , There are several different forms of logic used in AI research. Propositional logic: ,  or sentential logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false. First order logic and features such as equality: , , , ,  also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. Fuzzy logic:  Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. Starting in the late 80s and early 90s, Judea Pearl and others championed the use of methods drawn from probability theory and economics to devise a number of powerful tools to solve these problems. (on Judea Pearl's contribution). Stochastic methods are described in all the major AI textbooks: , , , ,   Bayesian networksBayesian networks: , , ,  are very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), Bayesian inference algorithm: , , ,  learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), Bayesian learning and the expectation-maximization algorithm: , ,  planning (using decision networks)Bayesian decision networks:  and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).Dynamic Bayesian network:  Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov modelsHidden Markov model:  and Kalman filtersKalman filter: ). Planning problems have also taken advantages of other tools from economics, such as decision theory and decision analysis,decision theory and decision analysis: ,  information value theory,Information value theory:  Markov decision processes,Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks: dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism designGame theory and mechanism design:  The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if shiny then pick up"). Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers Statistical learning methods and classifiers: ,  are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches. A wide range of classifiers are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the "no free lunch" theorem. Various empirical tests have been performed to compare classifier performance and to find the characteristics of data that determine classifier performance. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is however still more an art than science. The most widely used classifiers are the neural network, kernel methods such as the support vector machine, Kernel methods:  k-nearest neighbor algorithm, K-nearest neighbor algorithm:  Gaussian mixture model, Gaussian mixture model:  naive Bayes classifier, Naive Bayes classifier:  and decision tree. Decision tree: , ,  The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of classification tasks  in order to find data characteristics that determine classifier performance. The study of neural networks Neural networks and connectionism: , , ,  began with cybernetics researchers, working in the decade before the field AI research was founded. In the 1960s Frank Rosenblatt developed an important early version, the perceptron. Perceptrons: ,  Paul Werbos discovered the backpropagation algorithm in 1974, Backpropagation: , ,  which led to a renaissance in neural network research and connectionism in general in the middle 1980s. The Hopfield net, a form of attractor network, was first described by John Hopfield in 1982. Neural networks are applied to the problem of learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning Competitive learning, Hebbian coincidence learning, Hopfield networks and attractor networks: .  and the relatively new field of Hierarchical Temporal Memory which simulates the architecture of the neocortex. Several algorithms for learning use tools from evolutionary computation, such as genetic algorithms Genetic algorithms for learning: ,  and swarm intelligence. Artificial life and society based learning: Control theory, the grandchild of cybernetics, has many important applications, especially in robotics. Control theory: , AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research: Lisp:  was developed by John McCarthy at MIT in 1958. ,  There are many dialects of Lisp in use today. Prolog: ,  a language based on logic programming, was invented by French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Phillipe Roussel, in collaboration with Robert Kowalski of the University of Edinburgh. AI applications are also often written in standard languages like C++ and languages designed for mathematics, such as Matlab and Lush. How can one determine if an agent is intelligent? In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the Turing test. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail. Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed subject matter expert Turing tests. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results. The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are: For example, performance at checkers is optimal, performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-humanComputer Chess#Computers versus humans, performance at Go is sub-humanComputer Go#Computers versus humans, and performance at many everyday tasks performed by humans is sub-human.  There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence.  The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behaviour, data-mining, driverless cars, robot soccer and games. Artificial intelligence has successfully been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, scientific discovery and toys.  Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence, sometimes described as the AI effect.     zh-min-nan:Jîn-kang tì-hūi jbo:rutni menli ksh:Artificial Intelligence simple:Artificial intelligence sh:Umjetna inteligencija Economist Herbert Simon and Alan Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive science, operations research and management science. Their research team performed psychological experiments to demonstrate the similarities between human problem solving and the programs (such as their "General Problem Solver") they were developing. This tradition, centered at Carnegie Mellon University,Then called Carnegie Tech would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 80s. Unlike Newell and Simon, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms. Researchers at MIT (such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert) found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad-hoc solutions -- they argued that there was no easy answer, no simple and general principle (like logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. Roger Schank described their "anti-logic" approaches as "scruffy" (as opposed to the "neat" paradigms at CMU and Stanford), When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications. This "knowledge revolution" led to the development and deployment of expert systems (introduced by Edward Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software. The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that truly enormous of amounts knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications. Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focussed on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive. and  Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of control theory in AI. These approaches are also conceptually related to the embodied mind thesis. Interest in neural networks and "connectionism" was revived by David Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s. In the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or operations research).  describe this movement as nothing less than a "revolution" and "the victory of the neats." 1965, H. A. Simon: "[M]achines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do" quoted in  1967, Marvin Minsky: "Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved." quoted in  Turing's "polite convention": If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being. This "convention" forms the basis of the Turing test., , ,  The artificial brain argument: The brain can be simulated. This argument combines the idea that a Turing complete machine can simulate any process, with the materialist idea that the mind is the result of a physical process in the brain.. Also see  and . The most extreme form of this argument (the brain replacement scenario) was put forward by Clark Glymour in the mid-70s and was touched on by Zenon Pylyshyn and John Searle in 1980. It is now associated with Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil. The Dartmouth proposal: Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. This assertion was printed in the program for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers. See also  Newell and Simon's physical symbol system hypothesis: A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action. This statement claims that essence of intelligence is symbol manipulation. and  Hubert Dreyfus argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a "feel" for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.Dreyfus criticized a version of the physical symbol system hypothesis that he called the "psychological assumption": "The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules". . See also , ,  and  Gödel's incompleteness theorem: A physical symbol system can not prove all true statements. Roger Penrose is among those who claim that Gödel's theorem limits what machines can do. This is a paraphrase of the most important implication of Gödel's theorems, according . See also , , , , ,  under “(2) The Mathematical Objection” Searle's "strong AI position": A physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states. Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the "mind" might be.. See also : "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis," although Searle's arguments, such as the Chinese Room, apply only to physical symbol systems, not to machines in general (he would consider the brain a machine). Also, notice that the positions as Searle states them don't make any commitment to how much intelligence the system has: it is one thing to say a machine can act intelligently, it is another to say it can act as intelligently as a human being. Default reasoning and the qualification problem: Many of the things people know take the form of "working assumptions." For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about birds in general. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.Default reasoning and default logic, non-monotonic logics, circumscription, closed world assumption, abduction (Poole et al. places abduction under "default reasoning". Luger et al. places this under "uncertain reasoning"): , , ,  Unconscious knowledge: Much of what people know isn't represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could actually say out loud. They take the form of intuitions or tendencies and are represented in the brain unconsciously and sub-symbolically. This unconscious knowledge informs, supports and provides a context for our conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of unconscious reasoning, it is hoped that situated AI or computational intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge. The breadth of common sense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge, such as Cyc, require enormous amounts of tedious step-by-step ontological engineering — they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time., ,  (Introduction),  Unsupervised learning: find a model that matches a stream of input "experiences", and be able to predict what new "experiences" to expect. Supervised learning, such as classification (be able to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from each category), or regression (given a set of numerical input/output examples, discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs). Reinforcement learning:Reinforcement learning: ,  It must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of game theory, decision theory, as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) For good human-computer interaction, an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions — at the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with. At best, it should appear to have normal emotions itself. "Uninformed" search algorithms eventually search through every possible answer until they locate their goal.Naive searches (breadth first search, depth first search and general state space search): , , ,  Naive algorithms quickly run into problems when they expand the size of their search space to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. Heuristic or "informed" searches use heuristic methods to eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to their goal, thus drastically reducing the number of possibilities they must explore.Heuristic or informed searches (e.g., greedy best first and A*): , , ,  Local searches, such as hill climbing, simulated annealing and beam search, use techniques borrowed from optimization theory.Optimization searches: , ,  Genetic algorithms are a form of optimization search that imitates the process of natural selection, searching for an artificial phenotype (i.e. any sort of pattern) which passes a fitness measure by producing many copies of the most successful versions (imitating inheritance) and modifying them slightly (imitating mutation).Genetic algorithms: , , ,  Propositional logic First order logic Fuzzy logic, a version of first order logic which allows the truth of statement to represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). Fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: description logics; situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time); causal calculus; belief calculus; and modal logics.
