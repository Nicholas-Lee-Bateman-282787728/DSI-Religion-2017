 The Armenian alphabet is an alphabet that has been used to write the Armenian language since the year 405 or 406.  Up to the 19th century, Classical Armenian had been the literary language; since then, the Armenian alphabet is used to write the two modern, literary and spoken dialects – Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian – which were developed during the same period.G.Khandjian - The Creation of the Armenian Letters The Armenian word for "alphabet" is այբուբեն (CA, EA: , or WA: ), named after the first two letters of the Armenian alphabet. In the table above, the superscript "h" () is the diacritic for aspiration in the International Phonetic Alphabet; an apostrophe () indicates an ejective consonant. Ancient Armenian manuscripts used many ligatures to save space. Some of the commonly used ligatures are: ﬓ (մ+ն), ﬔ (մ+ե), ﬕ (մ+ի), ﬖ (վ+ն), ﬗ (մ+խ), և (ե+ւ), etc. After the invention of printing Armenian typefaces made a wide use of ligatures as well. It is important to note that in new orthography the և character is not a typographical ligature anymore, and must never be treated as such. It is a distinct letter and has its place in the new alphabetic sequence. In Armenian ( , ) is a comma, ( : ) is the ordinary period, and ( ' ) is used as period for abbreviations. The question mark ( ՞ ) is placed between the last and the penultimate letters of the question word. The short stop ( ՝ ) placed in the same manner as the question mark, indicates a short pause that is longer than that of a comma, but shorter than that of a semicolon. The interjection sign ( ՛ ) is placed between the penultimate and last letter of the interjection. ( « » ) are used for quotation marks.  ISO 9985 (1996) transliterates the Armenian alphabet for modern Armenian as follows: In linguistic literature on Classical Armenian, slightly different systems are in use (in particular note that č has a different meaning). Hübschmann-Meillet (1913) have  The Armenian alphabet was created by Saint Mesrop Mashtots in AD 405 primarily for a Bible translation in the Armenian language. Various scripts have been credited with being the prototype for the Armenian alphabet, including Pahlavi, Syriac, and Phoenician. It has also been suggested that Ethiopic had an influence on certain letters of the alphabet Richard Pankurst. 1998. The Ethiopians: A History. p25. However, the order of the letters suggests that it was likely based on the Greek alphabet. Although both dialects of modern Armenian — Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian — use the same alphabet, due to the Western Armenian sound shift some letters are pronounced in a different way. This matters for the following letters (further information in the chart below): The number and order of the letters have changed over time. In the Middle Ages two new letters (օ , ֆ ) were introduced in order to better represent foreign sounds; this increased the number of letters from 36 to 38. Furthermore, the diphthong աւ  followed by a consonant used to be pronounced [au] (as in down) in Classical Armenian, f.e. աւր (awr, , day). Due to a sound shift it became pronounced , and since the 13th century it is written as օր (ōr). In Classical Armenian, աւ followed by a consonant represented the diphthong au; e.g. hawr (father's), arawr (plough), now written hôr, arôr; one word has kept aw, now pronounced av: աղաւնի pigeon; there are also a few proper names still having aw before a consonant: Տաւրռս Taurusn, Փաւստոս Faustus, etc. For this reason, today there are native Armenian words beginning with the letter օ (ō) although this letter was taken from the Greek alphabet to express the pronunciation of foreign words beginning with o . From 1922 to 1924, Soviet Armenia adopted a Reformed spelling of the Armenian language.  This generally did not change the pronunciation of individual letters, with some exceptions.  The Armenian Diaspora (including Armenians in Lebanon and Iran) have rejected the Reformed spelling and continue to use the classical Mashtotsian spelling.  They criticize some aspects (see the footnotes of the chart) and allege political motives behind the reform. As Petross Ter Matossian from Columbia University informs, for about 250 years, from the early 18th century until around 1950, more than 2000 books were printed in the Turkish language using letters of the Armenian alphabet. Not only Armenians read Armeno-Turkish, but also the non-Armenian (including the Ottoman Turkish) elite. The Armenian alphabet was also used alongside the Arabic alphabet on official documents of the Ottoman Empire, but was written in the Ottoman language. For instance, the first novel to be written in the Ottoman Empire was 1851's Akabi Hikayesi, written in the Armenian script by Hovsep Vartan. Also, when the Armenian Duzoglu family managed the Ottoman mint during the reign of Abdulmejid, they kept records in the Armenian script, but in the Turkish language. The Armenian alphabet is one of the five modern European alphabetic scripts identified in the Unicode standard version 4.0. (The other modern European alphabets are Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Georgian.)  Unicode Code Charts and Unicode Standard, Chapter 7 It is assigned the range U+0530&ndash;058F. Five Armenian ligatures are encoded in the "Alphabetic presentation forms" block (code point range U+FB13&ndash;FB17) ArmSCII-8 is the 8-bit encoding of the Armenian Standard Code for Information Interchange, developed between 1991 and 1999.  It uses part of the upper 128 codes in an 8-bit encoding to represent the Armenian alphabet, leaving the lower 128 codes for another alphabetic script (often Latin or Cyrillic).  This allows a single font to represent two alphabetic scripts.  For example, the Latin characters could occupy part of the first 128 codes (e.g. ASCII) while the Armenian characters would occupy part of the upper 128 codes. ArmSCII-8 was popular on the Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems.  To be able to read in Armenian, users had to download a font that implements the ArmSCII-8 encoding.  To be able to write in Armenian, users first had to download and install a freeware program that ran in the taskbar called "Armenian National Language Support."  With this program, a user would be able to type in both Armenian and another alphabetic script without having to change fonts, switching between writing scripts and keyboard layouts by invoking a keyboard shortcut (often Alt + Shift). With the development of the more advanced Unicode standard and its availability on the Windows 2000/XP/2003 and Linux operating systems, the ArmSCII-8 encoding has been rendered obsolete.  Nevertheless, ArmSCII-8 can still be found in use on some websites, which have not yet made the transition to Unicode. Arasan-compatible fonts are based on the encoding of the original Arasan font, which simply replaces the Latin characters (amongst others) of the ASCII encoding with Armenian ones.  For example, the ASCII code for the Latin character  (65) represents the Armenian character . An advantage of Arasan-compatible fonts over ArmSCII-8 fonts is that writing does not require the installation of a separate program; once the font is installed and selected for use, the user could use her QWERTY keyboard to type in Armenian.  A disadvantage over ArmSCII-8 is that an Arasan-compatible font can only be used for one alphabetic script; therefore, the user must change the Font family when creating a multi-script document (e.g. both Armenian and English).  Another disadvantage is that Arasan-compatible fonts only come in one keyboard layout: Western Armenian phonetic. While Arasan-compatible fonts were popular among many users on Windows 95 and 98, it has been rendered obsolete by the Unicode standard.  However, a few websites continue to use it. The Arasan font's legacy is the phonetic Armenian keyboard layouts that ship with Windows 2000/XP/2003, which are almost identical to the Arasan keyboard layout. The Armenian alphabet is available for use on personal computers in a variety of operating systems as installable fonts.  The native Windows XP font Sylfaen implements the Unicode Armenian character set.  The open source package DejaVu fonts implements the Unicode Armenian character set and is popular on Linux.  Note that since they are portable, fonts from one operating system (e.g. Windows) may be installed on another (e.g. Linux). An operating system can be configured to use a variety of keyboard layouts to suit the user's needs.  For example, both English and Western Armenian keyboard layouts may be configured, with the user being able to switch between the two using a keyboard shortcut (often alt + shift). Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003 ship with two Armenian language keyboard layouts: Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian.Windows Keyboard Layouts  They are both based on the keyboard layout of a popular Armenian font for Windows 95 named Arasan.  These keyboard layouts are generally phonetic.  However, since some letters in the Armenian alphabet do not have an obvious corresponding character in the Latin alphabet, they are often approximated (for example, Խ maps to Q).  Also, since there are more letters in the Armenian alphabet (38) than in Latin (26), some Armenian characters appear on non-alphabetic keys on a conventional English language keyboard (for example, շ maps to ,).   Armenian keyboard layouts for Windows 2000/XP/2003 created by third parties include the Armenian Phonetic Eastern and the Armenian Typewriter Eastern.Armenian Keyboard Layouts for Windows 2000/XP/2003 at ArmUnicode.org Use of Armenian keyboard layouts on Windows 2000/XP/2003 systems require explicit configuration by the user.Installing Unicode Armenian Language Support on Microsoft Windows Each Linux distribution may come pre-configured with a unique set of keyboard layouts.  To provide some consistency amongst themselves, Linux distributions often pull their layouts from the XKeyboard Configuration component of Freedesktop.org.  As of November, 2006, Freedesktop.org contains 5 Armenian keyboard layouts, including 2 layouts identical to the ones from Windows XP.XKeyboard Config CVS - the am file corresponds to the Armenian keyboard layout  As of version 10.1, SUSE Linux supports 2 Armenian keyboard layouts; it does not include the Windows XP layouts, but it is possible to manually install these.Installing the new Armenian Keyboard layouts for GNU/Linux Use of Armenian keyboard layouts on Linux usually requires explicit configuration by the user.
