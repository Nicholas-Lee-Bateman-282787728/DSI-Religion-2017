   No Doubt is a rock band from Anaheim, California, United States, founded in 1986. The ska-rock sound of its first album failed to make waves due to the popularity of the grunge movement at the time.  The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom helped to launch the ska revival of the 1990s, and "Don't Speak," the third single from the album, set a record when it spent sixteen weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart, later broken by the Goo Goo Dolls' "Iris." The group released its next album, Return of Saturn, four years later with a dominant New Wave sound, but despite positive reviews, the album was considered a commercial failure.  Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with Rock Steady, which incorporated reggae and dancehall music into their work.  The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie, and Lady Saw.  The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, "Hey Baby" and "Underneath It All." No Doubt released the compilation The Singles: 1992-2003 and box set Boom Box in 2003, both of which contained a cover version of the Talk Talk synthpop song "It's My Life."  Frontwoman Gwen Stefani launched her solo career the next year with several collaborations, including bandmate Tony Kanal and Neptune Pharrell Williams, while guitarist Tom Dumont began his side project, Invincible Overlord.  During its career, the band has won two Grammy Awards and sold 27 million records worldwide to date.MacDonald, Patrick.  "Gwen Stefani: She sings! She designs! She dances ... uh, um, no".

Eric, who had taught himself songs by 2 Tone band Madness on the piano, played keyboards for the band, and Spence was the lead vocalist with Gwen, who Eric had previously used to test out ideas for vocals, as a co-vocalist.  The trio recruited several more members within the month and had an unsteady line-up for several years.  It played small gigs around the Orange County area, with Spence's on-stage antics carrying its performances.  Tony Kanal went to one of these early shows and soon joined the band as its bassist.

Impressed by the presence of stage diving at ska concerts and Gwen's on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created Interscope Records in 1990.  No Doubt's self-titled debut album was released in 1992 and featured the single "Trapped in a Box."  The album's distinctly pop sound sharply contrasted with the grunge movement, and the album was a commercial failure, selling only 30,000 copies.  The band embarked on a national tour in support of the album, though Interscope had lost faith in the band and refused to support the tour.Bush, John.  "Biography".  All Music Guide.

Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording or rehearsing.

After some time in-between albums, No Doubt included its song "New" on the soundtrack to the movie Go in 1999.  "New," inspired by Gwen's budding relationship with Rossdale, was one of the first songs written after the release of Tragic Kingdom. In 2000, the band released Return of Saturn, its follow-up to Tragic Kingdom. The album featured a darker tone and was more lyrically advanced than No Doubt's previous work.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

Also released as singles from the album were the tracks "Simple Kind of Life" and "Bathwater." After Return of Saturn, the band returned to recording in January 2001.
