 Juan Esteban Aristizábal Vásquez best known as Juanes (born August 9, 1972 in Carolina del Príncipe, Antioquia) is a Colombian rock musician. During the 1980s and 1990s, Juanes was a member of heavy metal band Ekhymosis but disbanded the group in 1998 to pursue a solo career. His 2000 solo debut album, Fíjate Bien, had moderate commercial success and went on to win three Latin Grammy Awards. His second album, Un Día Normal was certified platinum throughout much of the Spanish-speaking world, and its lead single "A Dios le Pido" topped singles charts in twelve countries. Mi Sangre, his third album, fared equally well with Juanes promoting it on a tour with over 200 performances.  The album's third single, "La Camisa Negra", generated controversy after being used as a symbol for Italian neo-fascism. Juanes is one of the best-selling Colombian musicians, having sold more than ten million albums and won twelve Latin Grammys."Juan Luis Guerra, Juanes Top 13th Annual BMI Latin Awards".  BMI.
