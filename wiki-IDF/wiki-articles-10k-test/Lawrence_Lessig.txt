   Lawrence Lessig (born June 3 1961) is an American academic. He is a professor of law at Stanford Law School and founder of its Center for Internet and Society. He is founder and CEO of the Creative Commons and a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and of the Software Freedom Law Center, launched in February 2005. He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright, trademark and radio frequency spectrum, particularly in technology applications. At the iCommons iSummit 07 Lessig announced that he will stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters, and will instead work on corruption in the political system.  http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/required_reading_the_next_10_y_1.html This new work may be partially facilitated through his wiki — “Lessig Wiki” — which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption.Lessig’s blog July 29, 2007 11:55pm  In February 2008, a Facebook group formed by law professor John Palfrey encouraged him to run for Congress from California's 12th congressional district, the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative Tom Lantos. Later that month, after forming an "exploratory project", the decision was made not to run for the vacant seat.http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html Born in Rapid City, South Dakota, Lessig earned a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Management (Wharton School) from the University of Pennsylvania, an M.A. in philosophy from the University of Cambridge (Trinity) in England, and a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School. Prior to joining Stanford he taught at the Harvard Law School, where he was the Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, and the University of Chicago Law School. Lessig is considered a liberal, but he clerked for two influential conservative judges: Richard Posner and Justice Antonin Scalia. Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at Cambridge radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or libertarian political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active Teenage Republican serving as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the YMCA Youth & Government program[ ] in 1978 and almost pursued a Republican political career. What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy there and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the Eastern Bloc, so acquiring a lifelong interest in Eastern European law and politics. Lessig refuses to embrace the usual libertarianism. While Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention, he favors regulation by calling himself “a constitutionalist”. Because of his relative youth, and his intellectually innovative views of American legal theory, Lessig has often been cited as a potential candidate to fill vacant federal appellate judgeships in a future Democratic presidential administration. In his blog, Lessig has come out in favor of Democratic primary candidate Barack Obama, citing the transformative nature of Obama's campaign as one of his chief reasons. A campaign to draft Lessig to run for the US Congress from the Bay Area began in February 2008.[ ] In computer science, “code” typically refers to the text of a computer program (i.e., source code). In law, “code” can refer to the texts that constitute statutory law. In his book Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for social control, leading to his dictum that “Code is law”.  Lessig is also known for using a style of computer presentations typified by rapid display of short phrases or pictures.http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/free.html — Flash presentation of a Lessig “Free Culture” lecture and presentation James MacLennan calls his presentation style the “Lessig Method”.http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html In 2002, Lessig was awarded the Award for the Advancement of Free Software from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and on March 28, 2004 he was elected to the FSF’s Board of Directors.http://www.fsf.org/about/leadership.html In 2006, Lessig was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/april26/aaas-042606.html Lessig is also a well-known critic of copyright term extensions. He proposed the concept of “Free Culture.”http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/ He also supports free software and open spectrum.http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/ At his “Free culture” keynote at OSCON 2002, half of his speech was also about software patents, which he views as a rising threat to both free/open source software and innovation.   In March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the Digital Universe project.http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/03-14-2006/0004319554&EDATE= A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 Wikimania conference. Lessig is married to human-rights lawyer Bettina Neuefeind and they have two sons, Willem Dakota Neuefeind Lessig, who was born on September 7, 2003,http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001458.shtml and Teo Elias Neuefeind Lessig, who was born on January 15, 2007.http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003680.shtml In May 2005, it was revealed that Lessig had experienced sexual abuse by the director at the American Boychoir School which he had attended as an adolescent.http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html Lessig reached a settlement with the school in the past, under confidential terms. He revealed his experiences in the course of representing another student victim, John Hardwicke, in court.http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002912.shtml In August 2006, he succeeded in persuading the New Jersey Supreme Court to radically restrict the scope of immunity that had protected nonprofits which failed to prevent sexual abuse from legal liability.http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/decisions/supreme/a-17-04.doc.html Lessig appears as a character in a 2005 episode of the television political drama The West Wing (“The Wake Up Call”, season 6, episode 14). Lessig’s character, portrayed by Christopher Lloyd, is intended to be a realistic depiction including such details as citing his book The Future of Ideas and his expertise in Eastern European constitutional law. (Lessig’s comments on his blog) Artist group Monochrom performed a "Love Song for Lessig" on Boing Boing TV in the 2007-11-15 episode.http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/15/bbtv-marks-curie-eng.html The Austrian-German term "lässig" (meaning "cool" or "relaxed") is pronounced the same as Lessig's last name, and "Love Song for Lessig" uses the homonym for humor.

Microsoft (special master and author of an amicus brief addressing the Sherman Act[ ]) Lessig was appointed special master by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in 1997. The appointment was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[ ]. The appellate court ruled that the powers granted to Lessig exceeded the scope of the Federal statute providing for special masters. Judge Jackson then solicited Lessig’s amicus brief. Lessig himself says about this appointment: “Did Justice Jackson pick me to be his special master because he had determined I was the perfect mix of Holmes and Ed Felten? No, I was picked because I was a Harvard Law Professor teaching the law of cyberspace.
