    São Paulo () is the capital of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The city is the largest in Brazil and fifth in the world by populationhttp://sp450anos.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI236169-EI2551,00.html and is located in the South East of the country. It is also the richest city of Brazil. The name means Saint Paul in Portuguese. The city has an area of  and a population of 10,886,518, 2007 IBGE population count which makes it the most populous in Brazil, The Americas, and the southern hemisphereCitimayors website - Largest cities  (metro area: about 19 million).São Paulo developers eye boom times ahead People from the city of São Paulo are known as paulistanos, while paulistas designates anyone from the whole of São Paulo state, including the paulistanos. The city's Latin motto is Non ducor, duco, which translates as "I am not led, I lead". A famous nickname for the city is "Sampa". São Paulo is also known for its unreliable weather, the sheer size of its helicopter fleet, architecture and multitude of skyscrapers."Sao Paulo holds Gay Pride parade," BBC The São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport connects São Paulo with many Brazilian cities and also operates international flights.   Jesuit missionaries Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta founded the village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga on January 25, 1554. Along with their entourage, they established a mission named Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga aimed at converting the Tupi-Guarani Native Brazilians to the Catholic religion. Located just beyond the Serra do Mar cliffs, overlooking the port city of Santos, and close to the Tietê River, the new settlement became the natural entrance from the South East coast to the vast and fertile plateau to the West that would eventually become the State of São Paulo. São Paulo officially became a city in 1711. In the 19th century, it experienced a flourishing economic prosperity, brought about chiefly through coffee exports, which were shipped abroad from the port of the neighbouring city of Santos. After 1881, waves of immigrants from Italy, Portugal, Spain, Germany and many other countries emigrated to São Paulo in order to, among other reasons, work at the enormous coffee plantations established in the State. At the beginning of the 20th century, the coffee cycle had already plummeted due to, among other factors, a sharp decline in international coffee prices. The local entrepreneurs then started investing in the industrial development of São Paulo, attracting new contingents of overseas immigrants to the city, mainly Italians. In addition to Europeans, Japanese and Arab immigrants arrived in large numbers in the first half of the 20th century. Along the 20th century, the booming economy of the city also attracted huge waves of migrants from poor regions of Brazil, specially from Northeast Brazil.  However, due to competition with many other Brazilian cities, which sometimes offer tax advantages for companies to build manufacturing plants in situ, São Paulo's main economic activities have gradually left its industrial profile in favour of the services industry over the late 20th century. The city is home to a large number of local and international banking offices, law firms, multinational companies and consumer services. Another important historical landmark is the University of São Paulo's Law School, also known as Largo São Francisco, claimed to be one of the three first academic institutions in Brazil along with the Law School of Recife and the Federal University of Amazonas. Originally installed into a monastery, it was founded by an Imperial Decree on 1 March 1828, shortly after the beginning of the Brazilian Empire, following the increasing need for lawyers and politicians. As wealthy Brazilians would often go to Europe to take undergraduate law courses, the Brazilian Emperor, Dom Pedro I, decided that it would be fitting to create a national law school. It began to attract students from across the country, who were a strong contributing factor to São Paulo's distinctly bohemian lifestyle. Despite its many woes, São Paulo remains the business hub of Latin America. Having prospered first with coffee and then with industrialisation, in the early 21st century it expanded into the tertiary sector. Its huge market (nearly 20 million people in greater São Paulo) is a magnet for multinationals. Thanks to events such as the Bienal International de Arte, and its reputation for hosting cutting-edge music concerts, it has become something of a cultural centre as well. Economic growth and an export lifted employment and wages. The murder rate has dropped by almost a quarter since its peak. The historic centre profited with the return of the city’s government and the arrival of private universities, though businesses continue to move out to new boom districts such as Itaim and Berrini. São Paulo also claims to attract more visitors (mostly, but no longer exclusively, on business) than Rio de Janeiro, testimony of the intense rivalry between the two Brazilian metropolises.    In light of its economic and demographic weight, São Paulo has always played a pivotal role in Brazilian politics. With a constituency larger than that of many Brazilian states, the mayor's office is viewed by politicians as a springboard for state and national-level offices. São Paulo's most recent mayors were:   São Paulo is located on a plateau that is part of the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for "Sea Range"), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around 800 metres (2,625&nbsp;ft) above sea level - though at a distance of only about  from the Atlantic Ocean. This distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see "Transportation" section below) that roll down the range, leading to the portuary city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo but in the North of the city - where the Serra da Cantareira Range boasts higher elevations and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The entire region is very stable tectonically, and no significant seismic activity has ever been recorded. The Tietê River was once a source of freshwater and leisure for São Paulo. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, it became grossly polluted by raw sewage and industrial effluents, much like its tributary the Pinheiros River. However, a substantial clean-up program for both rivers are in the pipeline, financed by international development banks such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.Brazilian Departamento de Águas e Energia Elétrica, "International Competitive Bidding Tender Announcement" Neither river is navigable in the stretch that flows through the city, however water transport becomes increasingly important on the river Tietê further downstream (towards South, near river Paraná), as the river is part of the River Plate basin. There are no large natural lakes in the region, but the Guarapiranga and Billings reservoirs in the outskirts of São Paulo are used for power generation, water storage, and leisure activities such as sailing. The original flora consisted mainly of a great variety of broadleaf evergreens. Today, non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be cultivated, with eucalyptus being especially ubiquitous. According the Köppen climate classification São Paulo has a humid subtropical climate. Temperatures seldom reach 30 °C (86 °F) during summer, while frost is rare during winter. All-time record temperatures are 35.3 °C (96.6 °F) on November 15, 1985 and -2.1 °C (28 °F) on August 2, 1955 (both at the Mirante de Santana National Weather Station, in the north region). In the mountains around the city (Horto Florestal), -3.9 °C (25 °F) was recorded also in August 2, 1955 (unofficially). Snow flurries were reported officially just on one occasion on June 25, 1918. Rainfall is abundant, especially in the warmer months, but rare between June and August. Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone, and tornadic activity is uncommon. August is a month which, in the last years, despite of belonging to the winter, is mostly dry and hot, sometimes reaching temperatures of 28 °C (82.4 °F). This is a phenomenon called "veranico" (in portuguese, "little summer"). On other hand, January may have some relatively low temperatures in some years.   São Paulo is officially inserted in a larger metropolitan region named "Grande São Paulo" ("Greater São Paulo"). The region holds 39 municipalities in total, and a population of more than 19 million inhabitants (as of 2005, according to IBGE). Because São Paulo is sprawling like Los Angeles, it has two definitions for its metropolitan area.  By its CSA (Combined Statistical Area) type definition of metropolitan area, it is the second largest city in the world with 29 million inhabitants (Complexo Metropolitano Expandido).Empresa Paulista de Planejamento Metropolitano S.A. The more narrowly defined Greater São Paulo metropolitan area, which doesn't include Campinas, Baixada Santista and many other nearby areas (Região Metropolitana de São Paulo) has around 19,7 million inhabitants (2006), making it the fifth most populous metropolitan area in the world.  The city of São Paulo is divided into 31 boroughs, called subprefectures (subprefeituras in Portuguese). Each subprefecture is divided into several districts (in most cases, two or three). The subprefectures with the largest number of districts are the boroughs of Sé, in the historical downtown, Butantã, the location of the University of São Paulo, Lapa, Penha and Mooca, all having eleven districts.Together with the administrative division, there is also a geographic radial division established in 2007 by the mayor Gilberto Kassab. The city is divided in ten regions (historical downtown, extended downtown, north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest), each one identified with a distinct color in the buses and in the street plaques. These divisions have no relationship with the subprefectures and districts, and, in some cases, the same district may be in two or more geographic regions. The district where the headquarters of the subprefecture is located receives the same name of the subprefecture, with exception of M'Boi Mirim.

After the end of the African slave traffic in the country (1850), São Paulo started to replace the African manpower for immigrants in the coffee plantations. The pioneer in this new project was the senator Nicolau Vergueiro, who brought German, Swiss and Portuguese people to work in his own properties.http://www.faal.com.br/historiacidade.htm After the abolition of slavery (1888), São Paulo received large numbers of immigrants, most of them coming from Italy. In 1897, Italians were over half of the city's population. Portuguese, Spaniards, Germans, Jews and  Christian Lebanese and Syrians also came in significant numbers. From 1908 to 1950, many Japanese immigrants arrived.http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/especial/2005/saopaulo451/cronologia.shtmlIn the 1960s, Chinese and Koreans started arriving. In the mid-20th century, many people from the poor Northeast Brazil started to migrate to São Paulo. Nowadays, there is a growing Bolivian community in the city. As in all of Brazil, people of different ethnicities mix with each other, producing a multi-ethnic society. Today, people of 100 different ethnicities make São Paulo their home.http://www.radiobras.gov.br/especiais/saopaulo450/sp450_mat9_2004.htm The main communities are: Ethnically, São Paulo is made up of 8 million Whites, 2,6 million mixed-race (Pardos), 527 thousand Blacks, 456 thousand Asians and 18 thousand Amerindians.http://www.radiobras.gov.br/especiais/saopaulo450/sp450_mat15_2004.htm Source: IBGE 2000.http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&o=7&i=P&c=2094   As in all Brazil, the language spoken by the vast majority of the population is Portuguese. Due to the large influx of Italian immigrants, the Portuguese spoken in the city has a huge influence from the dialects of the Italian language. The Italian dialects mixed with the countryside Caipira accent of São Paulo; it is believed that São Paulo's way of speaking Portuguese was born in Mooca, a district settled in the early 20th century mainly by people from Naples, southern Italy.http://www.jornalmercadopaulista.com.br/cultura_jan2006.htmhttp://www.dcomercio.com.br/especiais/mooca450anos/18.htm Other languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: Liberdade district is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan. Although nowadays most Japanese Brazilians can speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent in Japanese. People of Chinese and Korean descent are slightly able to speak their ancestral languages. However, most of the Brazilian-born generations only speak Portuguese.http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/asiaticas/asiaticas.htm English and Spanish are taught in most schools, however very few people are really fluent speakers of them.

São Paulo (the municipality itself, without taking into account the whole of the metropolitan area) is the 19th richest city of the world and is expected to be the 13th richest in 2020.http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/bbc/2007/03/07/sao_paulo_sera_13_cidade_mais_rica_do_mundo_em_2020_diz_estudo_706174.html According to data of IBGE, its Gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005  was R$ 263,177,148,000.00 (US$ 156,280,780,941.00), equivalent to approximately 12.26% of the Brazilian GDP and 36% of all production of goods and services of the State of São Paulo.http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=1061&id_pagina=1 One of the biggest financial centers of Brazil and the world, São Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has become increasingly based on the tertiary sector, focusing on services and businesses for the country. Many analysts point to São Paulo as an important global city, even though this assignment can be criticized considering its serious problems of social exclusion and spacial segregation.FERREIRA, João Sette Whitaker;  The myth of the global city , presented thesis of doutorado to the FAUUSP, 2003 Although being the most important financial center of the country, São Paulo's economy also presents a high degree of informality. In Sao Paulo Bovespa is based the (Bolsa de Valores de Sao Paulo), Brazil's official stock and bonds exchange. The Bovespa is the largest stock exchange in Latin America and 8th largest in the world, having been through a process of IPO of its shares recently (it was once privately-owned by quotaholders). The GDP for the city was R$ 263,177,148,000 (2005). The per capita income for the city was R$ 24,083 (2005).  Adoniran Barbosa was a famous samba singer and composer that became successful in São Paulo's radio era. Born in 1912 in the town of Valinhos, Barbosa became the composer of the lower classes of São Paulo, particularly the poor Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bexiga (Bela Vista) and Brás, and the poor who lived in the city's many shanties and cortiços (degraded multifamily row houses). The topics of his songs are drawn from the life of low-wage urban workers, the unemployed and the vagabonds. His first big hit was Saudosa Maloca ("Shanty of Fond Memories", 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. In his Trem das Onze ("The 11 PM Train", 1964) record, which has been ranked one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Jaçanã suburb, for his mother will not sleep before he arrives. An old-school samba band called Demônios da Garoa still plays his songs in the traditional Bar Brahma venue in Centro.  In the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called Os Mutantes led the way in the national avant garde music scene. Their success is sometimes related to that of other tropicalia musicians, but they also had a musical style and ideas of their own. They were regarded as very paulistanos in their behaviour and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums together before lead singer Rita Lee departed in 1972 to start a solo career. Although almost exclusively known in Brazil at that time, Os Mutantes became quite successful abroad after the 1990s (a well-spread legend has it that one Brazilian girl in an exchange programme in California, U.S., forgot one Mutantes' vinyl record in her American host family, leading the way to the popularisation of the band in that U.S. state). In 2000, a record sung in English, Tecnicolor, was released with artwork designed by Sean Lennon.  After the two oil price shocks in the 1970s, the country suffered from an economic recession during the 1980s, a phenomenon that was named the lost decade. The very repressive military government of the day did not help in any way the social situation. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment and few actual prospectives from the viewpoint of the youth. Underground rock bars and clubs in town were full of thriving musicians and artists waiting for their moment to come. Examples of bands originating from this movement include Ira! and Titãs. In the 1990s, drum & bass became another musical movement in São Paulo, with artists such as DJ Marky, DJ Patife, XRS, Drumagick, and Fernanda Porto.Movement website Many heavy metal bands also originated in São Paulo, such as Angra and Torture Squad. Many "alternative" cultures of São Paulo mingle at a small shopping mall dubbed Galeria do Rock (English: "Rock Gallery"), which includes shops which cater to a broad range of alternative niches. The classical music in São Paulo is also very prevalent. Many of the most important classical Brazilian composers who are still alive, like Amaral Vieira, Osvaldo Lacerda and Edson Zampronha are born and live in São Paulo. São Paulo has two important opera houses: Teatro Municipal de São Paulo and Theatro São Pedro, and some opera performances are sometimes hosted in other theaters like Credicard Hall. The São Paulo State Symphony is one of the outstanding orchestras in Latin America and in the world.  São Paulo was home to the first jesuit missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the native peoples and composed pieces of poetry and music for the catechism. Among them were priests such as Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta, living in or near the colony then called Piratininga. They also helped to register the Old Tupi language, lexicon and its grammar. The Brazilian Modernist Movement as an organized trend started in São Paulo in 1922. Both these authors were influential writers form the Modernism in Brazil:   São Paulo is a major cultural centre. The city has an ethnically diverse metropolitan area, with heavy Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, African, Jewish, Arab and Japanese influences.  The city is known for its varied and sophisticated cuisine, ranging from Chinese to French, from fast food chains to five star restaurants. There are approximately 62 different types of cuisines in São Paulo, and more than 12,000 restaurants.São Paulo Convention and Visitors Bureau, "City Facts", retrieved 05 June 2007 Other venues such as bars, pubs, lounges and discos cater to a variety of music tastes. São Paulo is home to the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP) and "Pinacoteca do Estado" art museums, a symphonic orchestra (São Paulo State Symphony (OSESP - based in the Sala São Paulo theatre), and a Formula One Grand Prix racing circuit (Interlagos). São Paulo has 280 cinemas, 120 theatres, 71 museums, 39 cultural centers and about 70 shopping malls. There are some Web sites and magazines specialising in the cultural events in the city, including the Agenda Cultural de São Paulo (São Paulo's Cultural Calendar).Agenda Cultural   The São Paulo Art Biennial is a cultural event hosted in town every two years. Almost 1 million people visited the 26th Bienal in 2004. Its theme was chosen to enable a wide range of artistic positions to feel comfortable. The concept of "Free Territory" involved various dimensions: it had a physical-geographical, a socio-political as well as an aesthetic dimension&nbsp;&mdash; the latter, of course, being of greatest interest in the context of this exhibition. In order to emphasise the thematic unity of the overall exhibition, the invited artists and those representing the countries are mixed together on the 25,000 square metres of the spacious Oscar Niemeyer Pavilion. Despite the complexity of individual voices, the final result was intended to be a unity. In addition to an intensification of the North-South dialogue inside Brazil, the Bienal's aims include the promoting of links between non-European cultures along a South-South orientation. The next edition of the Biennale will take place in 2008. Brazil first entered the international fashion circuit with the increasing reputation of famous Brazilian top models such as Adriana Lima, Gisele Bündchen, Alessandra Ambrosio, Fernanda Tavares, Ana Beatriz Barros, Izabel Goulart and Ana Hickmann, and the "discovery" of some fresh talents such as Alexandre Herchcovitch by some international fashion magazines. As a consequence of this, SPFW is the place to see and to be seen in Brazilian fashion scene, always attracting a number of international editors and models. São Paulo Fashion WeekSão Paulo Fashion Week's Official Website is nowadays the fifth most relevant fashion events in the world. It takes place twice a year at the building of Bienal de São Paulo.  The tourist event in the city, the São Paulo Gay Parade attracted about 2.5 million people to Paulista Avenue in 2006. It is usually opened by the city's mayor. A large carnival runs along the avenue, with several Trio Elétricos. The last parade was held on June 10, 2007, and its organizers said that the parade attracted 3.5 million attendees. No official estimate was given by the Polícia Militar.BBC News website, "Sao Paulo holds Gay Pride parade", retrieved 14 June 2007. Folha Online website, "Parada Gay bate recorde, dizem organizadores", retrieved 14 June 2007. The March for Jesus is a Protestant parade that takes place every year in Paulista Avenue, now in another downtown avenue. It is organized by the Renascer Church, a Pentecostal denomination created in the 1980s and which has grown significantly in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2007, about two million people took part in the event, according to official estimates. The Electronic Language International FestivalFILE - Festival Internacional de Linguagem Eletrônica official website. is a non-profit cultural organization, whose purpose is to disseminate and to develop arts, technologies and scientific research, by means of exhibitions, debates, lectures, and courses. The festival promotes a yearly meeting in Brazil, in the city of São Paulo. The event is open to the public, and intends to expand its educational reach to local and eventually remote audiences, thus sharing the experiences learned with FILE, through technologies of education, communication, registration and memory. The File Festival show in its events web art, net.art, artificial life, hypertext, computer animation, real time teleconferences, virtual reality, panoramas, interactive movie, e- video, electronic art installations and robotics through interactive and immersive rooms. Every two years, Associação Cultural Videobrasil's International Electronic Art Festival brings groundbreaking work by cream-of-the-crop artists from all over the world to São Paulo. In keeping with the constant transformations in media and support, the curatorship has added installations, performances, VJs, CD-ROM art, and Internet art to the programme. The Festival includes a competitive exhibition of so-called southern circuit and an extensive parallel programme. Art shows, debates and meetings introduce new ideas and artwork, setting new guidelines for contemporary art in Brazil. Exhibitions featuring work by prominent electronic artists are also part of the Festival. Brazilian pioneers such as Rafael França and Olhar Eletrônico, and international guests such as Nam June Paik, Bill Viola and Gary Hill, have featured in the event’s past editions. Each edition has a theme of its own.Video Brasil website   As in the rest of Brazil, football is by far the most popular sport in the city. The major teams in São Paulo are Corinthians, Palmeiras and São Paulo FC. There are three other small clubs in the city, Portuguesa, Juventus and Nacional. Another popular club in São Paulo is Santos FC from the nearby coastal city of the same name, Santos. São Paulo is one of the 18 remaining candidates to host games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which Brazil is the host nation. Soccer/Football teams The São Silvestre Race takes place every New Year's Eve (31 December). It was first held in 1925, when the competitors ran about 8,000 metres across the streets. Since then, the distance raced has varied, and it is now fixed at 15 km. Registration takes place from 1 October, with the maximum number of entrants limited to 15,000. The Brazilian Grand Prix (Portuguese: Grande Prêmio do Brasil) is a Formula One championship race which occurs at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in Interlagos. In 2006 the Grand Prix was the final round of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship. The Spanish driver Fernando Alonso won the 2006 drivers championship at this circuit by coming second in the race. The race was won by the young Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, driving  for the Scuderia Ferrari team. Volleyball, basketball and tennis are other major sports. There are several traditional sports clubs in São Paulo that are home for teams in many championships. The most important are Esporte Clube Pinheiros (waterpolo, volleyball, swimming, basketball and handball), Clube Atlhetico Paulistano (basketball), Esporte Clube Banespa (volleyball, handball and futsal), Associação Atlética Hebraica (basketball) and São Paulo Athletic Club (rugby union). The following international sports events have been held in São Paulo:  The city is crossed by many of the most important Brazilian motorways, such as the BR-116, Rodovia Raposo Tavares, Rodovia Anhangüera, Rodovia dos Bandeirantes, Rodovia Anchieta, Rodovia Castelo Branco and Rodovia dos Imigrantes. Automobiles are still the main means to get into the city. São Paulo grew quickly from the 1940s to the 1980s and many roads and buildings were built without major planning.  As a result, heavy traffic is common on the city's main avenues, and traffic jams are relatively common on its largest highways. The main means of commuting into the city is by car and by bus.  An effective way of avoiding heavy vehicles traffic in the city, such as buses and trucks that crossed the city for other destinations, was planned by ex-governor Mário Covas as a road ring that circles the city, called Rodoanel Mario Covas,Dersa website, "Rodoanel Mario Covas" and is being built by DERSA.DERSA official website  Although poorly served by heavy rail services, there is an infrastructure project to build a high-speed railway service linking Brazil's two largest cities, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.Nasdaq website 2007, "Brazil May Take Bids On Rio-To-Sao Paulo High-Speed Rail Link" The trains would go as fast as 280 km per hour (the trip would last about 1 hour and 30 minutes). This specific project is still waiting an official announcement by the Brazilian government, who is trying to obtain international financing through a public-private partnership. Another important project is the "Expresso Bandeirantes", which is a medium-speed rail service (about 160 km/h) from São Paulo to Campinas, which would reduce the journey time from the current one hour and a half by car to about 50 minutes by train, linking the towns of São Paulo, Jundiaí, Campinas Airport, and Campinas city center. This service is also going to be connected to the railway service between São Paulo city center and Guarulhos Airport. Major works on an express railway service between São Paulo city center and Guarulhos International Airport were announced by the São Paulo state government in 2007,Secretaria dos Transportes Metropolitanos do Estado de São Paulo "PPP for construction of Guarulhos Airport Express railway", retrieved 05 Jun 2007 which will be a milestone in the revitalisation and improvement of the Brazilian passenger railway services.  São Paulo has three airports. There are two major airports in the São Paulo metropolitan area: São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (GRU, for domestic and international flights) and Congonhas, (CGH, for domestic flights). There's also a small airport known as Campo de Marte north of the Old Center for small, private aircraft and helicopters. Campo de Marte also hosts the Ventura Goodyear Blimp. Congonhas Airport operates domestic and regional flights, mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Campo de Marte airport handles some private and small-sized airplanes. Guarulhos International Airport, also known to São Paulo dwellers as "Cumbica", is located 25 km North East of the city centre, in the neighbouring city of Guarulhos. Guarulhos airport operates both domestic and international flights. On 2007-07-17 the worst airline accident in Brazil's history occurred at Congonhas airport, blamed on rain and a shortended runway. Nearly 200 people from the plane and on the ground died.  Following the accident, pilots refused to land under rainy conditions and the Brazilian President signed an act so that ticket sales for flights to the airport be stopped. Aviation throughout the entire country reached a crisis state, which is slowly being overcome by new safety measures such as the introduction of a grooved pavement in the runways. In 2006, about 34,3 million people went through the city's airports (mainly from Congonhas and Guarulhos International Airport, the only two operating commercial flights). Infraero, Brazil's main aviation authority, estimates that with the remodelling of Guarulhos Airport, São Paulo's airports will be able to handle about 45 million passengers a year within the next five years. There are also plans to expand the Viracopos-Campinas International Airport at Campinas, a city about 90 km North of São Paulo. São Paulo has allegedly one of the highest per capita helicopter ownership in the world. The owners are an elite wealthy class who take advantage of around one hundred helipads and heliports to conveniently avoid heavy traffic.Brazil's Elites Fly Above Their Fears Washington Post article dated June 1, 2002.  The city has 61 km of underground railway systems (34.6 km fully underground) (the São Paulo Metro,Downloadable map (pdf) of the underground network retrieved from the Metro SP website. locally known as the Metrô),  with 4 lines in operation and 55 stations, complemented by another 253,2 km of Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM, or "Paulista Company of Metropolitan Trains") railways. Both CPTM and the underground railway lines carry some 3,5 million people on an average weekday, and a few new underground lines to be constructed are expected to add another million people to the system within the next five years. The projects expected to expand São Paulo's urban railway system from the current 330 km to more than 500 km on the next 10 years.All the main projects from the São Paulo railway and underground system for the next 10 years can be found on the Metrô website and CPTM (in Portuguese). São Paulo has three rapid transport systems: São Paulo has no tram lines, although trams used to be common in the first half of the 20th century.For the history of São Paulo tramways, see Tramz website São Paulo's underground train system is modern, safe, clean and efficient, considered one of the best subway systems in the world, as certified by the NBR ISO 9001. It has four lines (the newest one, the Yellow line, is under construction, thus unavailable at the moment) and links to the metropolitan train network, the CPTM.    By 2009, the new Line 4 - Yellow, will be ready for use. The state government has built some underground stations in the Line 5 - Lilac, but although operating fully, this line is yet to be integrated with the main subway system. The lilac line serves only the subprefecture of Santo Amaro, but it is planned to be extended and connected with the lines 1 and 2. On January 12, 2007, at 3:15 p.m. local time, a sinkhole opened in the future line 4 (yellow) Pinheiros station of São Paulo's underground system. Seven people were killed (four of them in a passing shuttle bus which was swallowed and buried by the cave-in). The accident caused serious structural damage to many houses in the surrounding area, forcing their households to move to hotels and the homes of relatives. Prior to the accident, many reports concerning fissures in the walls of these houses had been noticed. Officials of the company hired by the State of São Paulo Government to build the station blamed excessive rain as a primary cause, although outside pundits say what really happened was insufficient soil analysis, since the future Pinheiros underground station is very close to the river Pinheiros. After the accident, another concern was a large crane that threatened to fall over neighboring homes, until it was later dismantled by engineers working on the project.News from UOL websiteFolha de S.Paulo newspaper website  The bulk of the public transport (government and private companies) is composed of approximately 17,000 buses (including about 210 trolley buses), coloured uniformily according to the non-central region served (ex.: light green for the buses that go South West, dark blue for the Northern area).   Until the past few years, there was a strong presence of informal transport vans (dab vans), but the vast majority of such vans are already fully registered with the city council, legalized and operating under the same color scheme of the main system.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been the major economic center of Latin America. With the arrival of the two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were critically affected, leading wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities which eventually turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub. The new job positions thereof contributed to attracting a significant number of immigrants from other regions of the country, especially northeastern states. From a population of merely 32,000 inhabitants in 1880, São Paulo increased its population to approximately 250,000 in 1900, 1,800,000 in 1940, 4,750,000 in 1960 and 8,500,000 in 1980. The effects of this population boom have been: Effective 2008-01-01, the city will implement the first of its new "Clean City Law" policy. All outdoor signage, public transportation and video screens will be removed in an effort to reduce the amount of "visual pollution".     als:São Paulo be-x-old:Сан-Паўлу lij:São Paulo pms:San Paùl ëd Brasil scn:San Paulu dû Brasili simple:São Paulo sh:Sao Paulo vec:San Pagoło del Braxil bat-smg:San Pauls Mayor Entry in Left Office in Political Party Gilberto Kassab 2006 - Democratas José Serra 2005 2006 PSDB Marta Suplicy 2001 2004 PT Celso Pitta 1997 2000 PPB, later PTN Paulo Maluf 1993 1996 PPB (PP) Luiza Erundina 1989 1992 PT Jânio Quadros 1986 1988 PTB Mário Covas 1983 1985 PMDB   Table Climate of Sao Paulo Temperature Mounth Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record High°C 35,4 34,7 34,9 33,3 30,9 29,3 30,2 33,0 35,3 35,4 35,5 35,6 33,9 Average high °C 27.3 28.0 27.2 25.1 23.0 21.8 21.8 23.3 23.9 24.8 25.9 26.3 23,5 Average low °C 18.7 18.8 18.2 16.2 13.8 12.4 11.7 12.8 13.9 15.3 16.6 17.7 15,5 Record low °C 9,6 9,9 9,6 4,0 1,4 -0,6 -1,2 -2,1 -0,4 4,7 5,3 7,7 4,0 Precipitation Mounth Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Seo Oct Nov Dec Total mm 241 203 142 58 43 38 28 36 58 150 122 198 1317 Religion Percentage Number Catholic 68.11% 7,107,261 Protestant 15.94% 1,663,131 No religion 8.97% 936,474 Kardecist 2.75% 286,600 Buddhist 0.65% 67,591 Jewish 0.36% 37,500 Club League Venue Established Palmeiras Série A(First Division) Palestra Italia Stadium 1914 São Paulo FC Série A(First Division) Morumbi Stadium 1935 Portuguesa Série A(First Division) Canindé Stadium 1920 Corinthians Série B(Second Division) Parque São Jorge Stadium - Not used for matches due to small size. 1910 Juventus Série C(Third Division) Rua Javari Stadium 1924 Nacional Série C(Third Division) Nicolau Alayon Stadium 1919  Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (1981)  Algiers, Algeria (2005)  Amman, Jordan (1997)  Asunción, Paraguay (1998)  Bamako, Mali (2000)  Barcelona, Spain  Beijing, PR China (1999)  Beirut, Lebanon  Belo Horizonte, Brazil  Budapest, Hungary (2000)  Buenos Aires, Argentina (1999)  Cairo, Egypt  Cluj-Napoca, Romania (2000)  Coimbra, Portugal (1996)  Córdoba, Spain (2001)  Damascus, Syria (1999)  Funchal, Portugal (1998)  Góis, Portugal (2000)  Havana, Cuba (1997)  Johannesburg, South Africa (1995)  La Paz, Bolivia (1999)  La Plata, Argentina (1989)  Leiria, Portugal (1996)  Lima, Peru  Lisbon, Portugal (1995)  Luanda, Angola (1993)  Macau SAR, China (1999)  Mendoza, Argentina (1998)  Mexico City, Mexico  Miami, USA (1988)  Milan, Italy (1962)  Montevideo, Uruguay (2001)  Naha, Japan (1998)  Osaka, Japan (1985)  Presidente Franco, Paraguay (1994)  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1995)  San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain (1990)  San José, Costa Rica  Santiago, Chile (1998)  Santiago de Compostela, Spain (2000)  Seoul, South Korea (1977)  Shanghai, PR China (1988)  Sydney, Australia (1997)  Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1999)  Yerevan, Armenia (1999) 6 million Italians (including descendants).

The CPTM network is longer than the underground rail system. The fast-lane bus system: there are many such bus lines in the city, called "Passa Rápido", which are street-level, placed on large avenues, and connected with the underground or suburban train stations. Line 1 - Blue: The first Metrô line built connects the North and the South Side of São Paulo. Connections are available for the Green, Red and Yellow lines and also for CPTM trains. Tietê and Jabaquara bus terminals are also reachable through the use of this line. Line 2 - Green: The Green line transverses the Avenida Paulista ridge, connecting Ipiranga to Vila Madalena, and also integrating the Blue and Yellow lines. Line 3 - Red: One of São Paulo's busiest lines, it connects the East Side to the West Side. Connections to the Blue and Yellow lines are possible, as are with CPTM trains. The Barra Funda bus terminal is located on this line. Line 4 - Yellow (under construction): Scheduled to be open in the near future, the Yellow line will connect the central Luz station to the South side in a route constructed immediately below the Consolação and Rebouças avenues. Connections will be available to the Blue, Green and Red lines and to CPTM trains. Line 5 - Lilac: Built for users who need to reach specific places in São Paulo's South Side. Only a short distance of the line is already available (six complete stations), connecting to CPTM trains at Santo Amaro station. Although urban planning has been implemented in some areas, São Paulo has developed quickly without major planning. Overcrowded public transport associated with a high number of cars and other vehicles in circulation lead to consistently congested traffic on many roads of the city. Due to heavy usage and poor maintenance, the quality of the pavement on certain roads (especially in the outskirts of the city) is problematic, and potholes and other asphalt defects are common. Although the situation is improving, crime rates and gang violence are still high,Economist.com website, "No end of violence", published 12 April 2007, retrieved 19 July 2007. especially in the numerous city slums and peripheral neighbourhoods. According to a federal government research, the city itself ranks 493rd in the list of the 5565 most violent cities in Brazil, but ranks second in the number of firearm-related deaths.
