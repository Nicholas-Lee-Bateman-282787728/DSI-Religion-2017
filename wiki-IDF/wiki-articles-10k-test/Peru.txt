   Peru (, , ), officially the Republic of Peru (, ), is a country in western South America. It is bordered on the north by Ecuador and Colombia, on the east by Brazil, on the southeast by Bolivia, on the south by Chile, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peruvian territory was home to the Norte Chico civilization, one of the oldest in the world, and to the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty, which included most of its South American colonies. After achieving independence in 1821, Peru has undergone periods of political unrest and fiscal crisis as well as periods of stability and economic upswing. Peru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions.  Its geography varies from the arid plains of the Pacific coast to the peaks of the Andes mountains and the tropical forests of the Amazon Basin. It is a developing country with a medium Human Development Index score and a poverty level around 45%. Its main economic activities include agriculture, fishing, mining, and manufacturing of products such as textiles. The Peruvian population, estimated at 28 million, is multiethnic, including Amerindians, Europeans, Africans and Asians. The main spoken language is Spanish, although a significant number of Peruvians speak Quechua and other native languages. This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music. The word Peru is derived from Birú, the name of a local ruler who lived near the Bay of San Miguel, Panama, in the early 16th century.Raúl Porras Barrenechea, El nombre del Perú, p. 83. When his possessions were visited by Spanish explorers in 1522, they were the southernmost part of the New World yet known to Europeans.Raúl Porras Barrenechea, El nombre del Perú, p. 84. Thus, when Francisco Pizarro explored the regions farther south, they came to be designated Birú or Peru.Raúl Porras Barrenechea, El nombre del Perú, p. 86. The Spanish Crown gave the name legal status with the 1529 Capitulación de Toledo, which designated the newly encountered Inca Empire as the province of Peru.Raúl Porras Barrenechea, El nombre del Perú, p. 87. Under Spanish rule, the country adopted the denomination Viceroyalty of Peru, which became Republic of Peru after independence.  The earliest evidence of human presence in Peruvian territory has been dated to approximately 11,000 years BCE.Tom Dillehay et al, "The first settlers", p. 20. The oldest known complex society in Peru, the Norte Chico civilization, flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3000 and 1800 BCE.Jonathan Haas et al, "Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru", p. 1021. These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures such as Chavin, Paracas, Mochica, Nazca, Wari, and Chimu. In the 15th century, the Incas emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the largest empire in pre-Columbian America.Terence D'Altroy, The Incas, pp. 2&ndash;3. Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as irrigation and terracing; camelid husbandry and fishing were also important. Organization relied on reciprocity and redistribution because these societies had no notion of market or money.Enrique Mayer, The articulated peasant, pp. 47&ndash;68.  In 1532, a group of conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro defeated Inca Emperor Atahualpa and imposed Spanish rule. Ten years later, the Spanish Crown established the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included most of its South American colonies.Recopilación de leyes de los Reynos de las Indias, vol. II, pp. 12&ndash;13. Viceroy Francisco de Toledo reorganized the country in the 1570s with silver mining as its main economic activity and Indian forced labor as its primary workforce.Peter Bakewell, Miners of the Red Mountain, p. 181. Peruvian bullion provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines.Margarita Suárez, Desafíos transatlánticos, pp. 252&ndash;253. However, by the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income.Kenneth Andrien, Crisis and decline, pp. 200&ndash;202. In response, the Crown enacted the Bourbon Reforms, a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the Viceroyalty of Peru.Mark Burkholder, From impotence to authority, pp. 83&ndash;87. The new laws provoked Túpac Amaru II's rebellion and other revolts, all of which were defeated.Scarlett O'Phelan, Rebellions and revolts in eighteenth century Peru and Upper Peru, p. 276. In the early 19th century, while most of South America was swept by wars of independence, Peru remained a royalist stronghold. As the elite hesitated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, independence was achieved only after the military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar.Timothy Anna, The fall of the royal government in Peru, pp. 237&ndash;238. During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.Charles Walker, Smoldering ashes, pp. 124&ndash;125. National identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a Latin American Confederation foundered and a union with Bolivia proved ephemeral.Paul Gootenberg, Between silver and guano, p. 12. Between the 1840s and 1860s, Peru enjoyed stability under the presidency of Ramón Castilla due to increased state revenues from guano exports.Paul Gootenberg, Imagining development, pp. 5&ndash;6. However, by the 1870s, these resources had been squandered, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.Paul Gootenberg, Imagining development, p. 9.    Peru was defeated by Chile in the 1879&ndash;1883 War of the Pacific, losing the provinces of Arica and Tarapacá in the treaties of Ancón and Lima. Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the Civilista Party, which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of Augusto B. Leguía.Ulrich Mücke, Political culture in nineteenth-century Peru, pp. 193&ndash;194. The Great Depression caused the downfall of Leguía, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA).Peter Klarén, Peru, pp. 262&ndash;276. The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades.David Palmer, Peru: the authoritarian tradition, p. 93. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General Juan Velasco Alvarado, staged a coup against president Fernando Belaunde. The new regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development but failed to gain widespread support.George Philip, The rise and fall of the Peruvian military radicals, pp. 163&ndash;165. In 1975, Velasco was forcefully replaced as president by General Francisco Morales Bermúdez, who paralyzed reforms and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.Daniel Schydlowsky and Juan Julio Wicht, "Anatomy of an economic failure", pp. 106&ndash;107. During the 1980s, Peru faced a considerable external debt, ever-growing inflation, a surge in drug trafficking, and massive political violence.Peter Klarén, Peru, pp. 406&ndash;407. Under the presidency of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000), the country started to recover; however, accusations of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights violations forced his resignation after the controversial 2000 elections.BBC News, Fujimori: Decline and fall.

It neighbors Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The Andes mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean, dividing the country into three geographic regions. The costa (coast), to the west, is a narrow plain, largely arid except for valleys created by seasonal rivers. The sierra (highlands) is the region of the Andes; it includes the Altiplano plateau as well as the highest peak of the country, the 6,768&nbsp;m (22,205&nbsp;ft) Huascarán.AndesHandbook, Huascarán.

Almost 60% of the country's area is located within this region.Instituto de Estudios Histórico&ndash;Marítimos del Perú, El Perú y sus recursos: Atlas geográfico y económico, p. 16. Most Peruvian rivers originate in the Andes and drain into one of three basins. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently. Tributaries of the Amazon River are longer, have a much larger flow, and are less steep once they exit the sierra. Rivers that drain into Lake Titicaca are generally short and have a large flow.Instituto de Estudios Histórico&ndash;Marítimos del Perú, El Perú y sus recursos: Atlas geográfico y económico, p. 31. Peru's longest rivers are the Ucayali, the Marañón, the Putumayo, the Yavarí, the Huallaga, the Urubamba, the Mantaro, and the Amazon.Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática, Perú: Compendio Estadístico 2005, p. 21.  Peru, unlike other equatorial countries, does not have an exclusively tropical climate; the influence of the Andes and the Humboldt Current causes great climatic diversity within the country. The costa has moderate temperatures, low precipitations, and high humidity, except for its warmer, wetter northern reaches.Instituto de Estudios Histórico&ndash;Marítimos del Perú, El Perú y sus recursos: Atlas geográfico y económico, pp. 24&ndash;25.

Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática, Condiciones de Vida en el Perú: Evolución 1997&ndash;2007, pp. 71&ndash;72 Historically, the country's economic performance has been tied to exports, which provide hard currency to finance imports and external debt payments.Rosemary Thorp and Geoffrey Bertram, Peru 1890&ndash;1977, p. 4. Although exports have provided substantial revenue, self-sustained growth and a more egalitarian distribution of income have proven elusive.Rosemary Thorp and Geoffrey Bertram, Peru 1890&ndash;1977, p. 321. Peruvian economic policy has varied widely over the past decades. The 1968&ndash;1975 government of Juan Velasco Alvarado introduced radical reforms, which included agrarian reform, the expropriation of foreign companies, the introduction of an economic planning system, and the creation of a large state-owned sector. These measures failed to achieve their objectives of income redistribution and the end of economic dependence on developed nations.Rosemary Thorp and Geoffrey Bertram, Peru 1890&ndash;1977, pp. 318&ndash;319. Despite these adverse results, most reforms were not reversed until the 1990s, when the liberalizing government of Alberto Fujimori ended price controls, protectionism, restrictions on foreign direct investment, and most state ownership of companies.John Sheahan, Searching for a better society, p. 157.
