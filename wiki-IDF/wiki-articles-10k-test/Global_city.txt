    A global city or world city is a city deemed to be an important node point in the global economic system. The concept comes from geography and urban studies and rests on the idea that globalisation can be understood as largely created, facilitated and enacted in strategic geographic locales according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade. The most complex of these entities is the "global city," whereby the linkages binding a city have a direct and tangible effect on global affairs through more than socio-economic means, with influence in terms of culture, or politics.Sassen, Saskia - The global city: strategic site/new frontier The terminology of "global city", as opposed to megacity, is thought to have been first coined by Saskia Sassen in reference to London, New York and Tokyo in her 1991 work The Global City.Sassen, Saskia - The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo. (1991) - Princeton University Press.  ISBN 0-691-07063-6 Today, the term is often associated with the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network based at the geography department of Loughborough University, which aims to provide a categorization and ranking of world cities. World City status is seen as beneficial, and because of this many groups have tried to classify and rank which cities are seen as 'world cities' or 'non-world cities'.   Although there is a general consensus upon leading world cities, GaWC Research Bulletin 5, GaWC, Loughborough University, 28 July 1999 the criteria upon which a classification is made can affect which other cities are included.   An attempt to define and categorise world cities was made in 1999 by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC), based primarily at Loughborough University in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England. The roster was outlined in the GaWC Research Bulletin 5  and ranked cities based on provision of "advanced producer services" such as accountancy, advertising, finance and law, by international corporations. The GaWC inventory identifies three levels of world cities and several sub-ranks. Note that this roster generally denotes cities in which there are offices of certain multinational companies providing financial and consulting services rather than other cultural, political, and economic centres. There is a schematic map of GaWC cities at their website.The World According to GaWC, GaWC, Loughborough University Alpha world cities / full service world citiesInventory of World Cities, GaWC, Loughborough University Beta world cities / major world cities Gamma world cities / minor world cities Evidence of world city formation Strong evidence Some evidence Minimal evidence An attempt to redefine and recategorise leading world cities was made by GaWC in 2004. Global Cities Leading World Cities, GaWC, Loughborough University Well rounded global cities  Very large contribution: London and New York City. Smaller contribution and with cultural strengths: Los Angeles, Paris, and San Francisco. Incipient global cities: Amsterdam, Boston, Chicago, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, Toronto. Global niche cities - specialised global contributions  Financial: Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. Political and social: Brussels, Geneva and Washington, D.C. World Cities Subnet articulator cities  Cultural: Berlin, Copenhagen, Melbourne, Munich, Oslo, Rome, Stockholm. Political: Bangkok, Beijing, Vienna. Social: Manila, Nairobi, Ottawa. Worldwide leading cities  Primarily economic global contributions: Frankfurt, Miami, Munich, Osaka, Singapore, Sydney, Zurich Primarily non-economic global contributions: Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Atlanta, Basel, Barcelona, Cairo, Denver, Harare, Lyon, Manila, Mexico City,  Mumbai, New Delhi, Shanghai. The GaWC list is based on specific criteria and, thus, may not include other cities of global significance or elsewhere on the spectrum. For example, cities with the following: Selected criteria Rank !! Population of city (proper) !! Population of metropolitan area !! Percentage foreign born !! Expatriate cost of living !! Metro systems by annual passenger ridership !! Top 10 rail systems by length !! Annual passenger air traffic in a single airport http://www.aci.aero/aci/aci/file/Press%20Releases/2007_PRs/PR_180707_TOP10.pdf  !!

International, first-name familiarity; whereby a city is recognized without the need for a political subdivision.  For example, although there are numerous cities and other political entities with the name Paris or variations on it, one would say "Paris", not "Paris, France". Active influence on and participation in international events and world affairs; for example, New York City is home to the United Nations headquarters complex and consequently contains a vast majority of the permanent missions to the UN.PERMANENT MISSIONS TO THE UNITED NATIONS, UN, 29 April 2003 A fairly large population (the centre of a metropolitan area with a population of at least one million, typically several million). A major international airport that serves as an established hub for several international airlines. An advanced transportation system that includes several freeways and/or a large mass transit network offering multiple modes of transportation (rapid transit, light rail, regional rail, ferry, or bus).

In other parts of the world, cities which attract large foreign businesses and related expatriate communities; for example, Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Moscow. International financial institutions, law firms, corporate headquarters, international conglomerates, and stock exchanges (for example the World Bank, or the London Stock Exchange) that have influence over the world economy.
