    The Arabic alphabet is the script used for writing languages such as Arabic,  Persian, Urdu, and others.  Arabic is written from right to left, and is written in a cursive style of script.  There are 28 basic letters in the Arabic alphabet.   Just as different handwriting styles and typefaces exist in the Roman alphabet, there are Arabic scripts in a number of different Arabic calligraphy styles, including Naskh, , Shahmukhi, , Thuluth, Kufic, and  Hejazi.  After the Latin alphabet, the Arabic writing system is the second-most widely used alphabet around the world. The alphabet was first used to write texts in Arabic — most importantly, the , the holy book of Islam. With the spread of Islam, it came to be used to write many other languages, even outside of the Semitic family to which Arabic belongs.  Examples of non-Semitic languages written with the Arabic alphabet include Persian, Urdu, Pashto, Baloch, Malay, Balti, Brahui, Panjabi (in Pakistan), Kashmiri, Sindhi (in Pakistan), Uyghur (in China), Kazakh (in China), Kyrgyz (in China), Azerbaijani (in Iran) and Kurdish in Iraq and Iran. In order to accommodate the needs of these other languages, new letters and other symbols were added to the original alphabet. (See Arabic alphabets of other languages below.) The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 basic letters. Adaptations of Arabic script for other languages, such the Malay Arabic script, may have additional letters. There are no distinct upper and lower case letter forms. Both printed and written Arabic are cursive, with most of the letters directly connected to the letter that immediately follows.  A few letters do not connect with the following letter, even in the middle of a word.  Each individual letter can have up to four distinct forms, based on its position within in a word or group of letters.  These forms are: Some letters look almost the same in all four forms, while others show more variety. In addition, some letter combinations are written as ligatures (special shapes), including .  Many letters look similar but are distinguished with dots placed above or below their central part. These are regarded as an integral part of the letter, not as diacritics — the dots distinguish completely different letters (and sounds). For example, the Arabic letters transliterated as b and t have the same basic shape, but b has one dot below, , and t has two dots above, . The Arabic alphabet is an "impure" abjad&mdash;long vowels are written, but short ones are not&mdash;so the reader must be familiarized with the language in order to restore the missing vowels. However, in editions of the  or in didactic works vocalization marks are used, including a sign for vowel omission called the sukūn and one for consonant gemination called šadda. There are two collating orders for the Arabic alphabet. The original abjadī order () derives from the order of the Phoenician alphabet, and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the Latin alphabet. In the  order (), similarly-shaped letters are grouped together (see the next section). The latter is used wherever lists of names and words need to be sorted, as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries. However, when letters are used for numbering, the abjadī order is exclusively used. The special abjadī order (in two slightly different variants) was devised by matching an Arabic letter of the fully consonant-dotted 28-letter Arabic alphabet to each of the 22 letters of the Aramaic alphabet (in their old Phoenician alphabetic order, also used by the Hebrew alphabet) — and adding the six remaining Arabic letters at the end. The most common sequence is (from left to right): This is commonly vocalized as follows: Another vocalization is: Another abjadī sequence, mainly confined to the Maghreb, is: which can be vocalized as: Despite no longer being used as the standard order of the alphabet, the abjadī order is still used in things such as lists and outlines where a ordinal system of designating points of information or questions other than numbers is required. In other words, whereas a list in English might call its first point A its next point B, its next point C, then D, then E and so on down to Z, even today a list in Arabic would typically call its first point , then , then , ,  and so on down to , rather than , , , , , and so on down to , as the modern order might suggest. The order is, also, still used in Modern Arabic mathematical notation when allocating variable names. For example, when the letters أ (ʼalif) and ب (bāʼ) have already been used for variable names, conventionally, the next letter to be used would be ج (ǧim). Major software packages, like word processors, lack the capability of sorting or generating numbered lists according to this order. The following table provides all of the Unicode characters for Arabic, and none of the supplementary letters used for other languages. The transliteration given is the widespread DIN 31635 standard, with some common alternatives. See the article Romanization of Arabic for details and various other transliteration schemes. Regarding pronunciation, the phonetic values given are those of the standard pronunciation of literary Arabic, the Dachsprache which is taught in universities. Actual pronunciation between the varieties of Arabic may vary widely. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the article Arabic phonology. The Arabic script is cursive, and all primary letters have conditional forms for their glyphs, depending on whether they are at the beginning, middle or end of a word, so they may exhibit four distinct forms (initial, medial, final or isolated). However, six letters have only isolated or final form, and so force the following letter (if any) to take an initial or isolated form, as if there were a word break. For compatibility with previous standards, Unicode can encode all these forms separately; however, these forms can be inferred from their joining context, using the same encoding. The table below shows this common encoding, in addition to the compatibility encodings for their normally contextual forms (Arabic texts should be encoded today using only the common encoding, but the rendering must then infer the joining types to determine the correct glyph forms, with or without ligation).  There are 29 primary letters. The names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the Proto-Semitic language. The following are not individual letters, but rather different contextual variants of some of the Arabic letters. The broken alif (), commonly encoded as Unicode 0x0649 () in Arabic, is sometimes replaced in Persian or Urdu, with Unicode 0x06CC (ی), called "Persian yeh", in accordance with its pronunciation in those languages.  The glyphs are identical in isolated and final form (ﻯ ﻰ), but not in initial and medial position, where the Persian yeh gains two dots below (ﻳ ﻴ). The  has neither an initial nor a medial form. Although this is the common situation, the problem is not so simple, and no solution has been met yet as of September, 2007.Unicode problems; Arabic on Linux The only compulsory ligature is  + . All other ligatures ( + , etc.) are optional. :  :  Unicode has a special glyph for the ligature  (“God”). U+FDF2 ARABIC LIGATURE ALLAH ISOLATED FORM: :  The latter is a work-around for the shortcomings of most text processors, which are incapable of displaying the correct vowel marks for the word , because it should compose a small  sign above a gemination  sign. Compare the display of the composed equivalents below (the exact outcome will depend on your browser and font configuration): :  :  Short vowels are generally not written in Arabic, except in sacred texts (such as the , where they must be written) and sometimes in teaching material. These are known as vocalized texts. Short vowels are occasionally marked where the word would otherwise be ambiguous and could not be resolved simply from context, or simply wherever they are aesthetically pleasing. Short vowels may be written with diacritics placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; contrary to appearances, there is a consonant at the start of a name like Ali — in Arabic  — or of a word like . A long a following a consonant other than a hamza is written with a short a sign on the consonant plus an  after it; long i is written as a sign for short i plus a ; and long u as a sign for short u plus a . Briefly, aā = ā, iy = ī and uw = ū. Long a following a hamza may be represented by an  or by a free hamza followed by an ʼalif. In the table below, vowels will be placed above or below a dotted circle replacing a primary consonant letter or a šadda sign. For clarity in the table below, the primary letter on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form. Please note that most consonants do connect to the left with ,  and  written then with their medial or final form. Additionally, the letter  in the last row may connect to the letter on its left, and then will use a medial or initial form. Use the table of primary letters to look at their actual glyph and joining types. In unvocalized text (one in which the short vowels are not marked), the long vowels are represented by the consonant in question: ,  (or ), , or . Long vowels written in the middle of a word of unvocalised text are treated like consonants with a sukūn (see below) in a text that has full diacritics. Here also, the table shows long vowel letters only in isolated form for clarity. The diphthongs  and  are represented in vocalised text as follows: An Arabic syllable can be open (ending with a vowel) or closed (ending with a consonant). When the syllable is closed, we can indicate that the consonant that closes it does not carry a vowel by marking it with a diacritic called  (  ) to remove any ambiguity, especially when the text is not vocalized. A normal text is composed only of series of consonants; thus, the word , "heart", is written . The  indicates where not to place a vowel:  could, in effect, be read qalab (meaning "he turned around"), but written with a sukūn over the  and the  (), it can only have the form qVlb. This is one step down from full vocalization, where the vowel a would also be indicated by a : . The  is traditionally written in full vocalization. Outside of the , putting a  above a  — which represents  —, or above a  — which stands for  — is extremely rare, to the point that  with sukūn will be unambiguously read as the diphthong , and  with  will be read . For example, the letters  ( with an  at the end of the word) will be read most naturally as the word  (“music”).  If one were to write a  above the , the  and the , one would get , which would be read as   (note however that the final , because it is is an , never takes a ).  The word, entirely vocalized, would be written  in the , or  elsewhere.  (The Quranic spelling would have no  sign above the final , but instead a miniature  above the preceding  consonant, which is a valid Unicode character but most Arabic computer fonts cannot in fact display this miniature  as of 2006.) A  is not placed on word-final consonants, even if no vowel is pronounced, because fully vocalised texts are always written as if  the  vowels were in fact pronounced.  For example, , meaning “Ahmed is a bad husband”, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if still pronounced with full , i.e.  with the complete desinences. The  is also used for transliterating words into the Arabic script. The Persian word  (mâsk, from the English word "mask"), for example, might be written with a sukūn above the   to signify that there is no vowel sound between that letter and the . The , or shadda (   ّ   ), marks the gemination (doubling) of a consonant. A  (    ّ    ) may be written between the consonant and the  rather than under the consonant. The w-shaped  sign is derived from beginning of a small letter .  There are two kinds of numerals used in Arabic writing; standard numerals (predominant in the Arab World), and Eastern Arabic numerals (used in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India).  In Arabic, the former are referred to as "Indian numbers" ( ).  Arabic (or Hindu-Arabic) numerals are also used in Europe and the rest of the Western World, even though the Arabic alphabet is not, in a third variant, the Western Arabic numerals. In most of present-day North Africa, the usual western numerals are used; in medieval times, a slightly different set (from which, via Italy, Western Arabic numerals derive) was used. Like Arabic alphabetic characters, Arabic numerals are written from right to left, though the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most, just as with Western "Arabic numerals". Telephone numbers are read from left to right. In addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers (Abjad numerals). This usage is based on the abjadī of the alphabet.   is 1,   is 2,   is 3, and so on until   = 10,   = 20,   = 30, …,   = 200, …,   = 1000.  This is sometimes used to produce chronograms. The Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the Nabatean alphabet used to write the Nabataean dialect of Aramaic, itself descended from Phoenician. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late fourth-century inscription from Jabal Ramm (50 km east of Aqaba), but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at Zebed in Syria from 512.  However, the epigraphic record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them (the Aramaic model had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds!)  The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic papyrus (PERF 558), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts like the  were frequently memorized; this practice, which is still widespread among many Muslim communities today, probably arose partially from a desire to avoid the great ambiguity of the script. Later still, vowel marks and the hamza were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the seventh century, roughly contemporaneous with the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew vocalization.  Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an Umayyad governor of Iraq, Hajjaj ibn Yusuf: a dot above = , a dot below = ,  a dot on the line = , and doubled dots indicated nunation.  However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted.  The system was finalized around 786 by al-Farahidi. The Arabic script has been adopted for use in a wide variety of languages other than Arabic, including Persian, Kurdish, Malay and Urdu.  Such adaptations may feature altered or new characters to represent phonemes that do not appear in Arabic phonology. For example, the Arabic language lacks a voiceless bilabial plosive (the  sound), so many languages add their own letter to represent  in the script, though the specific letter used varies from language to language.  These modifications tend to fall into groups: all the Indian and Turkic languages written in Arabic script tend to use the Persian modified letters, whereas Indonesian languages tend to imitate those of Jawi. The modified version of the Arabic script originally devised for use with Persian is known as the Perso-Arabic script by scholars. In the case of Kurdish, vowels are mandatory, making the script an abugida rather than an abjad as it is for most languages.  Kashmiri, also, writes all vowels. Use of the Arabic script in West African languages, especially in the Sahel, developed with the penetration of Islam. To a certain degree the style and usage tends to follow those of the Maghreb (for instance the position of the dots in the letters fāʼ and qāf). Additional diacritics have come into use to facilitate writing of sounds not represented in the Arabic language. The term Ajami, which comes from the Arabic root for "foreign", has been applied to Arabic-based orthographies of African languages. Today Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and China are the main non-Arab states using the Arabic alphabet to write one or more official national languages, including Persian, Dari, Pashto, Urdu, Kashmiri, Sindhi, and Uyghur. The Arabic alphabet is currently used for: Speakers of languages that were previously unwritten used Arabic script as a basis to design writing systems for their mother languages. This choice could be influenced by Arabic being their second language, the language of scripture of their faith, or the only written language they came in contact with. Additionally, since most education was once religious, choice of script was determined by the writer's religion; which meant that Muslims would use Arabic script to write whatever language they spoke. This led to Arabic script being the most widely used script during the Middle Ages. See also Languages of Muslim countries. In the 20th century, the Arabic script was generally replaced by the Latin alphabet in the Balkans, parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, while in the Soviet Union, after a brief period of Latinization,Alphabet Transitions — The Latin Script: A New Chronology — Symbol of a New Azerbaijan, by Tamam Bayatly use of the Cyrillic alphabet was mandated. Turkey changed to the Latin alphabet in 1928 as part of an internal Westernizing revolution. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of the Turkic languages of the ex-USSR attempted to follow Turkey's lead and convert to a Turkish-style Latin alphabet. However, renewed use of the Arabic alphabet has occurred to a limited extent in Tajikistan, whose language's close resemblance to Persian allows direct use of publications from Iran.Tajik Language: Farsi or Not Farsi? by Sukhail Siddikzoda, reporter, Tajikistan. Most languages of the Iranian languages family continue to use Arabic script, as well as the Indo-Aryan languages of Pakistan and of Muslim populations in India, but the Bengali language of Bangladesh is written in the Bengali alphabet. The Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several character sets, including ISO-8859-6 and Unicode, in the latter thanks to the "Arabic segment", entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, neither of these sets indicate the form each character should take in context. It is left to the rendering engine to select the proper glyph to display for each character.  As of Unicode 5.0, the following ranges encode Arabic characters: The basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics, but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621–U+0652 being directly based on ISO 8859-6); and also includes the most common diacritics and Arabic-Indic digits. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as "end of ayah"  and "start of rub el hizb"  . The Arabic Supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms. See also the notes of the section on modified letters. Keyboards designed for different nations have different layouts so that proficiency in one style of keyboard such as Iraq's does not transfer to proficiency in another keyboard such as Saudi Arabia's.   Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters such as ' For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at The Unicode websiteSee also MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING WITH ARABIC AND ARABIC TRANSLITERATION Arabicizing Windows Applications to Read and Write Arabic & Solutions for the Transliteration Quagmire Faced by Arabic-Script Languages and A PowerPoint Tutorial (with screen shots and an English voice-over) on how to add Arabic to the Windows Operating System. The first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time has been developed by researchers at Ben-Gurion University. The prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second. The error rate is less than three percent, according to Dr. Jihad El-Sana, from BGU's department of computer sciences, who developed the system along with master's degree student Fadi Biadsy.Israel 21c Although Napoleon Bonaparte generally is given the credit  with introducing the printing press to the Arab world upon invading Egypt in 1798, and he did indeed bring printing presses and Arabic script presses, to print the French occupation's official newspaper Al-Tanbiyyah (The Courier), the process was started several centuries earlier. Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1450 was followed up by Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, who in 1514 published an entire prayer book  in Arabic script entitled Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i intended for the eastern Christian communities. The script was said to be crude and almost unreadable. Famed type designer Robert Granjon working for Cardinal Ferdinando de Medici succeeded in designing elegant Arabic typefaces and the Medici press published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late sixteenth century. The first Arabic books published using movable type in the Middle East were by the Maronite monks at the Maar Quz?hayy Monastery in Mount Lebanon. They transliterated the Arabic language using Syriac script. It took a fellow goldsmith like Gutenberg to design and implement the first true Arabic script movable type printing press in the Middle East. The Greek Orthodox monk Abd Allah Zakhir set up an Arabic language printing press using movable type at the monastery of Saint John at the town of Dhour El Shuwayr in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using true Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the elegant typeface. He created the first true Arabic script type in the Middle East. The first book off the press was in 1734; this press continued to be used until 1899.

Initially, the letter  indicated the glottal stop , as in Phoenician. Today it is used, together with  and , as a mater lectionis, that is to say a consonant standing in for a long vowel (see below). In fact, over the course of time its original consonantal value has been obscured, so  now serves either as a long vowel or as graphic support for certain diacritics (madda and hamza). The Arabic alphabet now uses  , the hamza, to denote the glottal stop, which can appear anywhere in a word.  This letter, however, does not function like the others: it can be written alone or with a carrier, in which case it becomes a diacritic: alone:  ; with a carrier:  (above and under a ),  (above a ),  (above a dotless   or ). Letters lacking an initial or medial version are never connected to the following letter, even within a word. As to the hamza, it has only a single form, since it is never connected to a preceding or following letter.

It is mainly used in Sri Lanka and the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu for religious purposes. Malayalam language represented by Arabic script varient is known as Arabi Malayalam.The script has particular alphabets to represent the peculiar sounds of Malayalam.This script is mainly used in Madrassas of South Indian state of Kerala to teach Malayalam. The Thaana script used to write the Dhivehi language in the Maldives has vowels derived from the vowel diacritics of the Arabic script. Some of the consonants are borrowed from Arabic numerals.

Turkish in the Ottoman Empire was written in Arabic script until Mustafa Kemal Atatürk declared the change to Roman script in 1928. This form of Turkish is now known as Ottoman Turkish and is held by many to be a different language, due to its much higher percentage of Persian and Arabic loanwords (Ottoman Turkish alphabet); Kurdish (Kurmanji dialect) in Turkey and Syria was written in Arabic script until 1932, when a modified Kurdish Latin alphabet was introduced by Jaladat Ali Badirkhan in Syria.
