   Family Guy is an American animated television series about a dysfunctional family in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island. It was created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox Broadcasting Company in 1999. The show uses frequent "cutaway gags", jokes in the form of tangential vignettes that do not advance the story. Family Guy was cancelled once in 2000, and again in 2002, but strong DVD sales and the large viewership of reruns on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim convinced Fox to resume the show in 2005. It is the first canceled show to be resurrected based on DVD sales.  Family Guy's first and second seasons were made starting in 1999 after the Larry shorts (its predecessor) caught the attention of the Fox Broadcasting Company during the 1999 Super Bowl commercial. Its cancellation was announced, but then a shift in power at Fox and outcry from the fans led to a reversal of that decision and the making of a third season, after which it was cancelled again. Reruns on Adult Swim drove interest in the show up, and the DVD releases did quite well, selling over 2.2 million copies in one year which renewed network interest.McKinley, Jesse. "Canceled and Resurrected, on the Air and Onstage", The New York Times, May 2, 2005. Accessed December 3, 2007. "First off, there was the countdown to the season premiere of "Family Guy," the animated Fox sitcom, which had been canceled in 2002, only to be revived after the show's DVD sales and its syndicated ratings caught the network's attention." Family Guy returned to production in 2004, making two more seasons (for a total of five) and a straight to DVD movie, Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story. The sixth season began airing in Autumn 2007, with a seventh season scheduled to air in the Autumn of 2008.  In addition, Family Guy went into syndication in Autumn, 2007.    The show revolves around the adventures of Peter Griffin, a bumbling but well-intentioned blue-collar worker. Peter is an Irish American Catholic with a thick Rhode Island / Eastern Massachusetts accent. His wife Lois, who has a similar accent, is generally a stay-at-home mother and piano teacher, and is a member of the Pewterschmidt family of wealthy socialites. Peter and Lois have three children: teenage daughter Meg, who is frequently the butt of jokes for her homeliness and lack of popularity; teenage son Chris, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, a younger version of his father; and infant son Stewie, a diabolical child with adult mannerisms who speaks fluently with an upper-class English accent and stereotypical arch-villain phrases. Living with the family is Brian, the family dog, who is highly anthropomorphized, walks on two legs, drinks Martinis, and engages in human conversation, though he is still considered a pet in many respects. There are many recurring characters on the show who appear alongside the Griffin family on a regular basis. These include the family's colorful neighbors: sex-crazed airline-pilot bachelor Glenn Quagmire; mild-mannered deli owner Cleveland Brown and his wife (ex-wife as of the fourth-season episode "The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire") Loretta Brown with their hyperactive son, Cleveland Jr.; paraplegic police officer Joe Swanson and his perpetually pregnant wife Bonnie; and creepy old gay pedophile Herbert. TV news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons also make regular appearances (along with Asian Reporter Tricia Takanawa and Blaccu-Weather meteorologist Ollie Williams), as well as mentally disturbed celebrity Mayor Adam West (voiced by and named after the real Adam West). Family Guy has not used an especially large cast of recurring minor characters (though this has changed to an extent in Season 4, with many one-shot characters from prior episodes reappearing in new episodes), and most of the episode plotlines center on the exploits of the Griffin family. The show has coined several words and phrases for humorous effect. Some words have only been used in one episode (such as "hic-a-doo-lah" in "Fore Father" and "festisio" in "The Thin White Line"), while a few have been used in several episodes. Quagmire's exclamation has been used in many episodes. A single "giggity" followed by "awwwright..." was the number 3 ring tone for the week ending February 7, 2007.Alex Woodson. "Net Effect: Voice Tones are a Family Affair." The Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved on 2007-03-17.  The main cast and their main parts are as follows: Seth MacFarlane, who voices Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, Brian Griffin, Glenn Quagmire, and Tom Tucker; Alex Borstein as Lois Griffin, Loretta Brown (until the character was retired in season four), and Trisha Takanawa; Seth Green as Chris Griffin; and Mila Kunis as Meg Griffin. The main cast do voices for several recurring characters other than those listed, as well as impersonate celebrities and pop-culture icons. Recurring cast members include: Patrick Warburton as Joe Swanson; Mike Henry as Cleveland Brown; Adam West as the mayor Adam West; Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson; John G. Brennan as Mort Goldman; Nicole Sullivan as Muriel Goldman; Carlos Alazraqui as Jonathan Weed (until the character was killed off in season three); Adam Carolla as Death (excluding his first appearance, during which the character was voiced by Norm MacDonald);  Lori Alan as Diane Simmons. Lacey Chabert voiced Meg Griffin for the first production season (15 episodes); however, because of a contractual agreement, she was never credited. She was eventually credited at the end of The Family Guy 100th Episode Special, which featured clips of her work. For the first half of the first season, the writers tried to work the words "murder" or "death" into the title of every episode to make the titles resemble those of old-fashioned radio mystery shows. On the DVD commentary for "Death Has a Shadow", creator Seth MacFarlane says that the writers stopped doing this when they realized they were beginning to get the titles confused. Beginning with "A Hero Sits Next Door", the episodes feature titles descriptive of their plots. Some episodes are not aired in full in their initial broadcast because of profanity or cultural references. Scenes are either re-edited or removed entirely from the episode. Some cut material is restored for later broadcast on other venues, such as Adult Swim. DVD releases also contain the uncensored material. The show has periodically featured the inclusion of certain elements from American Dad!, another animated comedy series created and produced by Seth MacFarlane. These cameos seem to imply that the two shows share the same fictitious universe. Appearances include:  Originally released as a direct-to-DVD movie, Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story comprises three episode length segments with a wraparound story. Different edits, both adding and deleting material, were eventually televised as the three-part season four finale ("Stewie B. Goode", "Bango Was His Name Oh!" and "Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure") The show often incorporates music numbers in Broadway style as part of its episode technique, either as tangential flashbacks or to advance the plotline. On April 26 2005 Family Guy: Live in Vegas was released and was a collaboration between composer Walter Murphy and Seth MacFarlane. It features a show tune theme. Only one song is related to the show, the theme song.  Also included was the music video "Sexy Party". During the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, official production of the show was halted for most of December of 2007 and various periods afterwards. Fox continued producing episodes without creator Seth MacFarlane's final approval which he termed as "a colossal dick move," in an interview with Variety. Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show, his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce. Production officially resumed after the end of the strike, with episodes airing regularly from February 17, 2008, onward.Fox Press Release [ ] In the United States, 28 episode podcasts were released on iTunes, and are also made available on the official site. These are audio-only promos where cast members talk about upcoming episodes and joke amongst themselves. The normal title sequence in Family Guy parodies TV programs like All in the Family with its nostalgic longing for values of days past. The sequence has had only small changes since the first episode in 1999:  Some title sequences are completely unique to select episodes. They are as follows: Family Guy and its cast have been nominated for 8 Emmy awards, with three wins: The show has also been nominated for nine Annies, and won twice, both in 2006. The show has also been nominated for a Golden Reel Award three times, winning once.  Family Guy has been panned by certain television critics, most notably from Entertainment Weekly, which was in turn attacked by MacFarlane during a scene in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story.  The show is criticized for using story premises and humor similar to those used in episodes of The Simpsons, another animated series on the Fox network. The Simpsons depicts Peter Griffin as a "clone" of Homer Simpson in a Halloween special, Story: "Send in the Clones" and as a fugitive accused of "Plagiarismo" (faux-Italian for plagiarism) in the episode "The Italian Bob". Family Guy is also mocked in a two-part episode of South Park, Continued in Cartoon Wars Part II in which characters call the show's jokes interchangeable and unrelated to storylines; the writers of Family Guy are portrayed as manatees who write by pushing rubber "idea balls" inscribed with random topics into a bin.  Seth MacFarlane responded to the criticism on the Volume 4 box set DVD commentary, saying it was completely founded and true, even giving reference to many skits and jokes that were meant for previously scripted episodes and later cut and recycled in future episodes. Other cartoonists who have publicly criticized Family Guy include John Kricfalusi, creator of Ren and Stimpy: "If you're a kid wanting to be a cartoonist today, and you're looking at Family Guy, you don't have to aim very high. You can draw Family Guy when you're ten years old. You don't have to get any better than that to become a professional cartoonist. The standards are extremely low." The show's penchant for irreverent humor led to a controversy over a sequence in which Peter Griffin dances, in classic musical fashion, around the bed of a man with end-stage AIDS, delivering the patient's diagnosis in song. The Hollywood Reporter recently announced that there are plans to produce a spin-off of Family Guy to be focused on Cleveland Brown. The project is tentatively named "Cleveland" and will be created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Henry (the voice of Cleveland), and American Dad! showrunner Rich Appel. In March of 2007, famed comedian Carol Burnett filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming that it was a copyright infringement for her Charwoman cleaning character to be portrayed on the show without her permission. Besides that, Burnett stated that Fox violated her publicity rights.  She was asking for $6 million in damages. On June 4, 2007, U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson tossed out the lawsuit, stating that the parody was protected under the First Amendment, using Hustler v. Falwell as a precedent. On October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of copyright infringement upon the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" by a parody song entitled "I Need a Jew", from the episode "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein". Bourne Co., the sole U.S. copyright owner of the song, alleges the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit are Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, Seth MacFarlane, and composer Walter Murphy; the suit seeks to stop the program's distribution, and unspecified damages. "Defendants' infringing activities have cause and will continue to cause Bourne great and irreparable harm. By associating Bourne's song with such offensive lyrics and other content in the episode, Defendants are harming the value of the song." Since "I Need a Jew" uses the copyrighted melody without commenting on that song, it may not be a First Amendment protected parody per the Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. ruling. In December of 2007, actor/comedian Art Metrano filed a lawsuit accusing the show of copyright infringement over a scene in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature "magic" act which involved absurd faux magical hand gestures (such as making a finger "jump" from one hand to the other) while humming the distinctive tune "Fine and Dandy". Metrano's suit claims this performance is protected under terms of the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976. Named in the suit are 20th Century Fox, show creator Seth MacFarlane, and collaborators Steve Callaghan and Alex Borstein. Metrano performed this well-known routine on programs such as The Tonight Show, where he made several appearances.    simple:Family Guy "Meet the Quagmires" &ndash; Roger, the alien who lives with the Smiths, makes a last-minute cameo in this episode, asking the Griffins, "Who ate all the Pecan Sandies?" His line is a reference to a line he said early in the American Dad! pilot episode, asking Francine if she bought Pecan Sandies while she was out shopping. He was voiced by Seth MacFarlane, who also voices him in American Dad!. "Blue Harvest" &ndash; Roger can be spotted conversing with one of the alien bar patrons while holding a glass of wine during the cantina scene. "Lois Kills Stewie" &ndash; CIA agent Stan Smith, the main character of American Dad!, as well as his supervisor Avery Bullock and the CIA Headquarters, are featured in this episode. Though the story is non-canon, these elements play a more prominent role in this episode, thus making it more of an actual crossover. Stan and Bullock were voiced by their usual American Dad! voice actors, Seth MacFarlane and Patrick Stewart, respectively. Stewie, Meg, and Chris' pictures in the background originally contained simple outlines, but beginning with "A Picture Is Worth a 1,000 Bucks", the pictures have shown the actual characters. Because so many people thought Stewie sang "effin' cry!" instead of "Laugh and cry" in the opening sequence (to the extent UK broadcaster Channel 4 would edit the line so Stewie would only be heard saying "Cry", and some versions of subtitles stating "F-in' cry!"), Seth MacFarlane resang that line to make it clearly "laugh and cry". The rerecording first appeared at the beginning of "The Kiss Seen Around the World" and remained through the end of season three, but the original recording returned when the show resumed airing on Fox in 2005, and has remained since. Starting Season 4, all main characters' vocals during the part "He's a family guy!" have been muted. The three "Road Trip" episodes ("Road to Rhode Island", "Road to Europe", "Road to Rupert") each has instead a sequence of still drawings representing that episode's road trip over an introductory musical fanfare taken from Road to Morocco. "Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High" – title sequence replaced with a parody of the series Law & Order. "PTV" &ndash; title sequence replaced with Osama Bin Laden going through various bloopers while trying to record a terrorist video before being beaten up by Stewie, followed by a Naked Gun parody going through familiar movie scenes, and finishing with a parody of The Simpsons title ending. "Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure" &ndash; title sequence replaced with a parody of the series 24 recapping events from the previous two episodes along with an unrelated clip from The Chevy Chase Show. This opening is only featured in the edited-for-television version of the episode. "Whistle While Your Wife Works" &ndash; same as the normal title sequence until the "musical stage" sequence, where Peter trips and falls down the stairs, rolling over Lois and Meg and crushing one of the dancers. Peter, oblivious to the suffocating dancer, complains he'll have a swollen foot. Stewie then pops up in front of the camera, awkwardly suggesting to the operator that he should turn it off. "Blue Harvest" &ndash; title sequence replaced with a parody of the opening crawl of Star Wars IV: A New Hope, utilizing the same fonts and music as that of the original film. 2000: Outstanding Voice-Over Performance &ndash; Seth MacFarlane for "Stewie Griffin" 2002: Outstanding Music and Lyrics &ndash; Walter Murphy (composer), Seth MacFarlane (lyricist) 2007: Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation &ndash; Steve Fonti (storyboard artist) Family Guy pinball machine Family Guy official website Family Guy Wiki at Wikia.com  :LINKNUM:184
