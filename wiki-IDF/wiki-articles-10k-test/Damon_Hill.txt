  Damon Graham Devereux Hill OBE (born 17 September 1960 in London) is a British former racing driver from England. He was the 1996 Formula One World Champion. As the son of the late double Formula One world champion Graham Hill, he is the only son of a world champion to win the title. Despite the famous family name, Hill had an uphill struggle to reach the ranks of F1. As well as his ability and achievements in racing, Hill won respect for his sportsmanship and dignity, and appreciation for his thoughtful, articulate interviews - invariably laced with quiet wit and dry humour.[ ] Damon Hill came to professional motorsports relatively late: he began racing motorcycles in 1983 at the age of 23. The following year, he won the 350&nbsp;cc Clubman's cup at Brands Hatch. In 1985, he moved on to four-wheel single-seater racing with Team Van Diemen in the Formula Ford championship, before moving up into the UK Formula 3 championship in 1986. After three seasons in Formula 3, where he won four races, Hill ascended another tier of open-wheel racing by joining Mooncraft in the International Formula 3000 championship, where, although often competitive, he never won a race. Hill started his Formula One career in 1992 with the then uncompetitive Brabham team. His debut race was at the British Grand Prix where he qualified on the back row. He took the first of his 22 victories at the 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix for the Williams team the following year. In 1994, he won the British Grand Prix, a race his father had never won in his long and successful career. During the mid 1990s, Hill was Michael Schumacher's main rival for the Formula One Driver's Championship, finishing runner-up in the German's 1994 and 1995 title seasons. The two had a series of controversial clashes on and off the track, including the collision at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix that gave Schumacher his first title by a single point. Hill took eight victories and the world championship in 1996. Despite this, Williams decided in mid-1996 not to renew Hill's contract for 1997. He went on to record the Jordan team's first ever win at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, and came within a few miles of being the only driver to win a Grand Prix for the Arrows team and their Yamaha engine supplier at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix. He retired from the sport at the end of the 1999 season, after 122 races. In 2006, Hill became president of the British Racing Drivers' Club, succeeding Jackie Stewart. Hill was born in Hampstead on 17 September 1960 to double Formula One world champion Graham Hill, who won his first World Championship two years after Damon's birth, and his wife Bette. Hill has two sisters, Samantha and Brigitte. Brigitte was an actress; she starred in her first film (Caravan to Vaccares) in 1974, and started Hill Marketing in 1998 after working with Damon. In 2002, she began managing the unrelated American racing driver Derek Hill, son of 1961 Formula One World Champion Phil Hill.Family Tree TheHillsForever.

He slowly graduated through Formula Ford, winning six races for Team Van Diemen in 1985. Hill then moved up into Formula Three where he raced for three different teams in three years, with a steady first season for Mooncraft in 1986 and brace of wins in each of the following years for Middlebridge Racing and then Intersport. In 1989 Hill progressed to Formula 3000, racing again for Mooncraft and then Middlebridge Racing over the next three years.

Hill took pole at the French GP and closely followed Prost but team orders prevented him from taking victory. He suffered four retirements in the first half of the season, including an engine failure at Silverstone while leading, and a tyre puncture near the end of the German Grand Prix. After that, the Englishman went on to win three successive races in Hungary, Belgium - where he and Michael Schumacher had a thrilling race - and Italy. In doing so he became the first son of a Formula One Grand Prix winner to take victory himself. Hill's third consecutive win clinched the constructors' championship for Williams and moved him up to second in the driver's standings until McLaren's Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last two races. Prost finished the season as champion. Traditionally the reigning driver's world champion carries the number '1' on his car; his team-mate takes the number '2'. As Nigel Mansell, the 1992 champion, was not racing in Formula One in 1993, his Williams team were given numbers '0' and '2'. As the junior partner, Hill took '0', the second man in Formula One history to do so, after Jody Scheckter in 1973. As a result of the major difference in build between Hill and Prost, the Frenchman being a foot shorter, Williams eventually opted to build two slightly different FW15C tubs. This was also as to accommodate Hill's size 12 feet, as he had repeatedly complained of cramp in the tight confines around the pedals. 1994  In 1994 the triple world champion Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams.

Schumacher struggled to second with a gearbox fault, having comfortably led the early laps. With four races left, Frank Williams brought back in 1992 champion Nigel Mansell to replace Coulthard. Mansell would get approximately £900,000 per race, while Hill was paid £300,000 for the entire season, though Hill's position as lead driver remained unquestioned.Hamilton, Maurice Frank Williams page 244 Macmillan ISBN 0-333-71716-3[ ] Although Schumacher dominated the early part of the season, leading 66 points to 29, Hill came back into contention for the title after winning the British Grand Prix, a race in which his late father had never tasted victory.Murray Walker & Simon Taylor Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes Page 138, Line 7–8 Virgin Books ISBN 1-85227-918-4 Schumacher was disqualified from that race and banned for two further races for overtaking during the formation lap and ignoring a black flag. Four more victories for Hill, three of which were in races where Schumacher was banned or disqualified, took the title battle to the final event at Adelaide. At Schumacher's first race since his ban, the European GP, he suggested that Hill (who was eight years Schumacher's senior) was not a world class driver. However, during the penultimate race at Suzuka, Hill took victory in a rain-soaked restart over Schumacher, putting Hill just one point behind the German. [ ] Neither he nor Schumacher finished the final race, in Adelaide, after a controversial collision which gave the title to Schumacher. Schumacher ran off the track while leading.

BBC Formula One commentator Murray Walker, a great fan and friend of Damon, has often maintained that Schumacher did not cause the crash intentionally. WilliamsF1 co-owner Patrick Head felt differently: After Schumacher's punishment for blocking the circuit during qualifying for the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, he told F1 Racing that in 1994 "Williams were already 100% certain that Michael was guilty of foul play", but did not protest Schumacher's title because the team was still dealing with the death of Ayrton Senna.'Ruthless' Schumi blasted Motoring.iafrica.com.

Schumacher hit top form and successfully defended his title with two races to spare, while Benetton took the constructors championship. Hill made several high profile errors in 1995, most notable in Britain and Italy. At the final race in Adelaide, Hill had one of the most dominating victories in the history of F1, finishing it two laps ahead of the runner-up.

Near the end of the season, Villeneuve began to mount a title challenge and took pole in the final race at Suzuka; however Hill reasserted his dominance at the start and took the victory while the Canadian retired. Hill celebrated his title win on the podium, alongside runner-ups Schumacher, now at Ferrari, and Mika Häkkinen of McLaren.

It was his first victory since being dropped by Williams, whose duo of Villeneuve and Frentzen won no races that season.

Struggling with the new four-grooved tyres introduced that year, he was outpaced by his new team-mate - none other than his replacement at Williams, Heinz-Harald Frentzen - and appeared to lose motivation. After an inglorious crash at Montreal he announced plans to retire at the end of the year, but after a miserable French Grand Prix he considered quitting immediately. Jordan persuaded Hill to stay on for Silverstone. Going into the weekend, Hill was talking of stopping after the race, so Jordan had tested Jos Verstappen as a contingency for Hill retiring mid-season.

Schumacher went on to win with Hill second. Schumacher's tactics earned him a one race suspended ban. Monza 1995: On lap 24 Hill and Schumacher collided when trying to lap Taki Inoue. Neither accepted blame. Hill questioned why Schumacher was "suddenly doing nought miles an hour", while many described it as a "reckless move" by Hill. Hill received a suspended one-race ban, which was never put into effect. Nurburgring 1995: On lap 18 Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher but the German blocked and squeezed him to the edge of the track. Hill locked up and hit the back of the Benetton. Hungary 1997: After qualifying third in the usually uncompetitive Arrows, Hill passed Schumacher cleanly on the inside on lap 11 going into the first corner before pulling away into the lead of the race. Canada 1998: Schumacher accused Hill of "dangerously weaving" while they were dicing for second. Hill responded by saying that Schumacher's comments were "rich" coming from someone who forced Heinz-Harald Frentzen off the track in the very same race.
