   Theatre (or theater, see spelling differences) (from French "théâtre", from Greek "theatron", θέατρον, meaning "place of seeing") is the branch of the performing arts defined as simply as what "occurs when one or more human beings, isolated in time and/or space, present themselves to another or others."Bernard Beckerman, head of Hofstra University's department of drama, in his book, Dynamics of Drama  By this broad definition, theatre has existed since the dawn of man, as a result of human tendency for story telling.  Since its inception, theatre has come to take on many forms, often utilizing elements such as speech, gesture, music, dance, and spectacle, combining the other performing arts, often as well as the visual arts, into a single artistic form.  Modern Western theatre is dominated by realism, although many other forms, including classical and experimental forms, as well as Eastern forms, are frequently performed. The earliest recorded theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the passion plays of Ancient Egypt.  This story of the god Osiris was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization, marking the known beginning of a long relationship between theatre and religion. The Ancient Greeks were the first to begin to formalize theatre as an art, developing strict definitions of tragedy and comedy as well as other forms, including satyr plays.  Like the passion plays of Ancient Egypt, Greek plays made use of mythological characters.  The Greeks were also the first to develop the concepts of dramatic criticism, acting as a career, and theatre architecture. Western theatre continued to develop under the Roman Empire, in medieval England, and continued to thrive, taking on many forms in Spain, Italy, France, and Russia in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.  A uniquely American theater developed along with the colonization of North America. The history of Eastern theatre is traced back to 1000 BC with the Sanskrit drama of India.  Japanese forms of Kabuki, Noh, and Kyogen date back to the 17th centuries. Other Eastern forms were developed throughout China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. There are many different types of theatre that have developed over time. In drama, the written word which the actors speak is the most important. Political theatre aims to educate the audience about current issues and events. Other types include black comedy,Commedia dell'arte, and  Tragicomedy. Drama (literally translated as action, from a verbal root meaning "To do") is the branch of theatre in which speech, either from written text (plays), or improvised is paramount. And the companion word drama is also Greek, dran meaning to do. The first theatre, the Theatre of ancient Greece, created the definition of a theatre: an audience in a half-circle watching an elevated stage where actors use props staging plays. Musical theatre is a form of theatre combining music, songs, dance routines, and spoken dialogue. However, theatre is more than just what one sees on stage. Theatre involves an entire world behind the scenes that creates the costumes, sets, and lighting to make the overall effect interesting. There is a long tradition of political theatre, which aims to educate audiences on contemporary issues and encourage social change.  The Catholic church took advantage of the entertainment value of theatre to create passion plays, mystery plays, and morality plays. An overview of the traditional theatres of India suggests that multiple systems of communication are ordered into hierarchies that vary from theatre to theatre.  Abstract masks and song-less mime dominate the Seraikella Chhau of Bihar, while the shifting use of municipal space flavours the grand Ram Lila at Ramnagar in Uttar Pradesh.  In the Kuchipudi theatre (Andhra Pradesh) and the Bhagavatamela (Tanjore district, Tamilnadu), elaborate dance and stylised hand gestures prevail.  Spectacular headdresses, costumes, and colour-coded makeup distinguish both the Kathakali theatre of Kerala and the Yakshagana of Karnataka.Hansen, Kathryn. Grounds for Play: The Nautanki Theatre of North India. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1992 1992. pp208-209 There are a variety of genres that writers, producers, and directors can employ in theatre to suit a variety of tastes: There are a variety of philosophies, artistic processes, and theatrical approaches to creating plays and drama. Some are connected to political or spiritual ideologies, and some are based on purely "artistic" concerns.  Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change.  According to Aristotle's seminal theatrical critique Poetics, there are six elements necessary for theatre: Plot, Character, Idea, Language, Song, and Spectacle. The 17th century Spanish writer Lope de Vega wrote that for theatre one needs "three boards, two actors, and one passion".  Others notable for their contribution to theatrical philosophy are Konstantin Stanislavski, Antonin Artaud, Bertolt Brecht, Orson Welles, Peter Brook, and Jerzy Grotowski. Some theatre theorists argue that actors should study all of the commonly-taught acting methods to perfect their craft (though many others disagree), such as the Meisner, Stanislavsky, Strasberg, and Hagen acting methods. Theatre, overall, encompasses people, ideas, and the works of art that result from their collaboration. The most recognisable figures in theatre are the directors, playwrights, and actors, but theatre is a highly collaborative endeavour. Plays are usually produced by a production team that commonly includes a scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer, sound designer, dramaturg, stage manager, and production manager.  The artistic staff is assisted by technical theatre personnel who handle creation and execution of the production.      nan:Hì-kio̍k ast:Teatru zh-min-nan:Hì-kio̍k be-x-old:Тэатар bar:Theata fur:Teatri nds-nl:Theater (keunstvorm) nap:Tiatro nrm:Thiâtre scn:Tiatru simple:Theater vec:Teatro fiu-vro:Tiatri bat-smg:Tētros Black comedy: Comedy that tests the boundaries of good taste and moral acceptability by juxtaposing morbid or ghastly elements with comical ones. Comedy: Comes from the Greek word komos which means celebration, revel, or merrymaking.  It does not necessarily mean funny, but can focus on a problem that leads to some form of catastrophe which in the end has a happy and joyful outcome. Comedy of manners: Witty, cerebral form of dramatic comedy that depicts and often satirises the manners and affectations of a contemporary society. A comedy of manners is concerned with social usage and the question of whether or not characters meet certain social standards. Commedia dell'arte: A very physical form of comedy which was created and originally performed in Italy.  Commedia uses a series of stock characters and a list of events to improvise an entire play. Devised theatre, also called 'collaborative creation': Where the piece is originally created not by a writer or writers, but by the performers themselves. Domestic drama: Drama that focuses on the everyday domestic lives of people and their relationships in the community where they live. Farce: A comic dramatic piece that uses highly improbable situations, stereotyped characters, extravagant exaggeration, fast pacing, and violent horseplay. Grand Guignol: Now broadly used to refer to any play with on-stage violence, the term originally referred to the bloody and gruesome melodramas produced at the Theatre du Grand Guignol in Paris, France. Improvisational theatre: A form of theatre where some or all of the action is created by the performers during the performance. Melodrama: Originally, a sentimental drama with musical underscoring.  Often with an unlikely plot that concerns the suffering of the good at the hands of the villains but ends happily with good triumphant.  Featuring stock characters such as the noble hero, the long-suffering heroine, and the cold-blooded villain. Meta-Theatre: A genre of theatre made popular with mostly modern audiences, although it did start back in the Elizabethan Era.  Meta-Theatre is when a play often completely demolishes the so called "fourth wall" and completely engages the audience.  Often about a group of actors, a director, writer and so on.  It usually blurs the line between what is scripted and what goes on by accident. Morality play: A morality play is an allegory in which the characters are abstractions of moral ideas. Musical theatre: A theatrical genre in which a story is told through the performance of singing (with instrumental music), spoken dialogue, and often dance. Natya: Sacred classical Indian musical theatre that includes natya proper (mime) and nritta (pure dance). Nautanki: A diverse Indian form of street plays consisting of folklore and mythological dramas with interludes of folk songs and dances. Opera: A theatrical genre in which a story is told and emotion is conveyed primarily through singing (with instrumental music). Pantomime: A form of musical drama in which elements of dance, mime, puppetry, slapstick, and melodrama are combined to produce an entertaining and comic theatrical experience, often designed for children. Poor Theatre: Jerzy Grotowski coined the phrase "poor theatre" in reference to the work he was doing with his theatre troupe in Poland.  Grotowski's style of poor theatre consisted of many important fine points.  For one, there was not a separate stage and place for the audience; instead the actors and the audience shared the same space.  There were no sets, props, lighting, music, or any other technical features.  The actors were paramount, although their costumes were simple.  Grotowski had his actors go through physical training, and even would spend many months rehearsing a play.  Some of these poor theatre plays would only be performed once, to a small audience.  This theatre style was very popular during the 1960’s and 70’s, and later on, was used by many acting troupes around the world. Physical theatre: Theatrical performance in which the primary means of communication is the body, through dance, mime, puppetry and movement, rather than the spoken word. Rock opera: Concept albums and stage works performed in a dramatic context reminiscent of opera, except that the musical form is rock music. Romantic comedy: A medley of clever scheming, calculated coincidence, and wondrous discovery, all of which contribute ultimately to making the events answer precisely to the hero's or heroine's wishes, with the focus on love. Satire: Plays of comedy/drama where the use of wit (mainly via humor), especially irony, sarcasm, and ridicule, to attack the vices and follies of humankind drives the story. Also: mocking, ironic, spoof, sardonic, humorous, tongue-in-cheek, and sarcastic themes, sayings, quips and tones of speech support the style. Theatre for social change: Theatre that addresses a social issue and uses performance as a way of illustrating injustice to the audience. Theatre of the Absurd: Term coined by Martin Esslin to refer to playwrights in Europe and the United States after World War II whose work reflected a sense of being adrift in a world where known values had been shattered.  No playwrights ever dubbed themselves "Absurdists," although it has become commonplace to refer to Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Harold Pinter, and Jean Genet, among others, by this term.  It can be seen as related to the philosophy of existentialism. Total Theatre: Most frequently invoked in reference to Richard Wagner's concept of a Gesamtkuntswerk, or "Total Art Work," in which music, drama, and dance operate together.  It has also been used by artists such as Steven Berkoff, who created a style where the actors become both characters and set, often using just one prop throughout the entire play.  The style uses features of Greek theatre (eg. a chorus or didactic message), exaggeration and surrealism. Tragedy: A drama that treats in a serious and dignified style the sorrowful or terrible events encountered or caused by a heroic individual.  The word "Tragedy" comes from the Greek word "Tragos" which is translated to "Goat".  The original meaning may come from the mystery plays of the cult of Dionysos, which centered on the god being killed and his body ripped to pieces, and with a goat or other animal as a proxy for the bloodshed. Tragicomedy: A drama that has a bitter/sweet quality, containing elements of tragedy and comedy. Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro de Bogotá. Edinburgh International Festival.
