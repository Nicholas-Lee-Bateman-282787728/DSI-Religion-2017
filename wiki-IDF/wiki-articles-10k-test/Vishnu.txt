 For other meanings, see Vishnu (disambiguation).  Vishnu (IAST ,  Devanagari ), (honorific: Sri Vishnu) also known as Narayana, is the Supreme Being (i.e., God ) or Ultimate Reality for Vaishnavas and a manifestation of Brahman in the Advaita or Smarta traditions of Hinduism. The Vishnu Sahasranamahttp://www.swami-krishnananda.org/vishnu/vishnu_1.html describes Vishnu as the All-Pervading essence of all beings, the master of and beyond the past, present and future, the creator and destroyer of all existences, one who supports, sustains and governs the Universe and originates and develops all elements within. In the Puranas, Vishnu is described as being the color of clouds (dark-blue), four-armed, holding a lotus, mace, conch and chakra (wheel). Vishnu is also described in the Bhagavad Gita as having a 'Universal Form' (Vishvarupa) which is beyond the ordinary limits of human sense perception http://www.vedabase.net/bg/11/3/en1 "..see the cosmic manifestation". It is also within the Puranas that the information regarding Vishnu's avatars is given. Nine of these avatars, or 'incarnations' are described as having occurred in the past, with one still to happen at the end of Kali Yuga. The Bhagavad Gita mentions their purpose as being to rejuvenate Dharma Bhagavad Gita 4.7 "...at that time I descend Myself"  and vanquish negative forces. In virtually all the Sanatana Dharma traditions, Vishnu is worshipped, either directly or through avatars such as Rama, Krishna, Varaha and Narasimha. In the Trimurti, Vishnu is responsible for the maintenance or 'preservation' of the Universe, with the other roles of creation and destruction being under the care of Brahma and Shiva, respectively.  The traditional Sanskrit explanation of the name  involves the root , meaning "to settle, to enter", or also (in the Rigveda) "to pervade", and a suffix , translating to approximately "the All-Pervading One". An early commentator on the Vedas, Yaska, in his Nirukta, defines Vishnu as 'vishnu vishateh; one who enters everywhere', and 'yad vishito bhavati tad vishnurbhavati; that which is free from fetters and bondages is Vishnu.' Adi Sankara in his commentary on Vishnu Sahasranama states derivation from this root, with a meaning "presence everywhere" ("As he pervades everything, vevesti, he is called Visnu"). Adi Sankara states (regarding Vishnu Purana, 3.1.45):  "The Power of the Supreme Being has entered within the universe. The root  means 'enter into.'" Swami Chinmayananda, in his translation of Vishnu sahasranama further elaborates on that verse: The root Vis means to enter. The entire world of things and beings is pervaded by Him and the Upanishad emphatically insists in its mantra "whatever that is there is the world of change." Hence, it means that He is not limited by space, time or substance. Chinmayananda states that which pervades everything is Vishnu. Swami Chinmayananda's translation of Vishnu sahasranama pgs. 16-17, Central Chinmaya Mission Trust . Regarding the suffix, Manfred Mayrhofer Indo-Aryan etymological dictionary, 1996, II.566f. proposes that the nasal is analogous to  "victorious". Mayrhofer further suggests that the name goes back to an already  Indo-Iranian , and was replaced by  in Zoroastrian Iran. The root  is also associated with  "all" (possibly by popular etymology, the word is generally believed to derive from Indo-Iranian , influenced by  "all", but a minority opinion does, indeed, derive  as from , (J. Knobloch (1980)). Suggestions involving other roots include  "crossing the back",  "facing towards all sides" and  "active", as well as attempts to explain Vishnu as a combination of two unrelated words, or as being derived from a non-Aryan root Mayrhofer, A Concise  Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary (1976) III.231f., J. Gonda, Aspects of Early Visnuism (ISBN 81-208-1087-2, reprint 1993) for a collection of references). The name is continued in Prakrit .  In the Rigveda, Vishnu is mentioned 93 times. He is frequently invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he assists in killing Vritra, and with whom he drinks Soma. His companionship with Indra is still reflected by his later titles Indrānuja and "Upendra", both referring to Vishnu as being the brother of Indra. His distinguishing characteristic in the Vedas is his association with Light, or even his identification with the Sun. The most celebrated act of Vishnu in the Rigveda is the 'three steps' by which he strode over this (universe) and in three places planted his step. The 'Vishnu Sukta' of the Rig Veda (1.154) says that the first and second of Vishnu's strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to men and the third is in the heights of heaven (sky). This last place is described as Vishnu's supreme abode in RV 1.22.20: The princes evermore behold  / that loftiest place where Visnu is / Laid as it were an eye in heaven. (trans. Griffith) Griffith's "princes" are the sūri, either "inciters" or lords of a sacrifice, or priests charged with pressing the Soma. The verse is later quoted as expressing Vishnu's supremacy by Vaishnavites, (In the Rigveda the Sun is not a high-ranking deity, c.f. e.g. RV 2.12.7, He who gave being to the Sun and Morning, who leads the waters, he, O men, is Indra. (trans. Griffith) where Indra appears as senior to the Sun.) One early commentator, Aurnavabha, who is mentioned by Yaska in his Nirukta, interprets the three steps as the different positions of the sun at his rising, culmination, and setting.  Though such solar aspects have been associated with Vishnu by tradition as well as modern-scholarship, he was not just the representation of the sun for in Rigveda he traverses in his strides both vertically and horizontally. In hymns I.22.17, 1.154.3, 1.154.4 he strides across the earth with three steps, in VI.49.13 , VII.100.3 strides across the earth three times and in I.154.1,I.155.5,VII.29.7 he strides vertically, with the final step in the heavens. The same Veda also says he strode wide and created space in the cosmos for Indra to fight Vritra. By his stride he said to have made dwelling for men possible, the three being a symbolic representation of its all-encompassing nature. This all-enveloping nature, assistance to Indra and benevolence to men were to remain the enduring attributes of Vishnu. As the triple-strider he is known as Tri-vikrama and as Uru-krama for the strides were wide. (The reference to the three strides of Vishnu in the Rig Veda is most possibly a prototype for the later legend of Vamana.) In the Vedas, Vishnu appears not yet included in the class of the Adityas (unless it is implied that he is identical with Surya, and included as the eighth Aditya), but in later texts he appears as heading them. It is inexplicable how Vishnu (and Shiva) rose to the prominence enjoyed currently by referring only to the Vedic hymns as Indra and Agni are invoked far more. It must be remembered that these hymns are liturgical in nature and meant primarily for the Soma sacrifice, especially dear to Indra. They may not represent the popular religion of those times as Jan Gonda cautions. Gonda also gives an elaborate theory of how the notion of Vishnu spread over various hymns contains the germs of future attributes. In some Rigvedic hymns, Indra seeks the help of Vishnu in destroying Vritra, indicating that he is not sufficient to accomplish it on his own. In another interpretation, the characteristic of Vishnu as the Supreme God appeared much earlier in the Vedic texts. For example, the following Vedic hymns express that point of view: 1. Purusha Sukta of Taittiriya Aranyaka (3.13.2) also refers master of Hri and Lakshmi (Vishnu) as Purusha, the Supreme God. 2.  Visvakarma Sukta of Rig Veda (10.82) refers to Vishnu indirectly as the Supreme God. 3. The Rig Veda (1.22.20) states, : "All the suras (i.e., the devas) look always toward the feet of Lord Vishnu." There are also hymns in Rigveda which describe Vishnu as Jagathkartha -meaning 'he who created everything'. The foreword of P. Sankaranarayan's translation of Vishnu sahasranama, Bhavan's Book University, cites Rig Veda V.I.15b.3, for the importance of chanting Vishnu's name, "O ye who wish to gain realization of the supreme truth, utter the name of Vishnu at least once in the steadfast faith that it will lead you to such realization."  By the age of the Brahmanas, various stories can be found associating Vishnu with the act of religious sacrifice (Yajna). The sacrifice being the core of interest for these texts, this association goes a long way in explaining the importance of Vishnu. How this association came about is not clear, but the various stories in the Brahmanas seem to explain a fait accompli. Vishnu is said to have become the most important of all gods by truly 'understanding' the meaning of the sacrifice before all else. In the Shatapatha Brahmana, he is described as winning the sacrifice back from Asuras as a dwarf, where the kernel of the Vamana incarnation can be seen. Aitareya Brahmana: 1:1:1 mentions Vishnu as the Supreme God. The Upanishads that form the philosophical culmination of the Vedas are dated at approximately 900 BCE. The purportedly oldest of these texts are the Chhandogya and Brhadaranyaka Upanishads. The former does not name Vishnu and the latter mentions him as part of ritual to obtain an exceptionally wise and learned son along with other deities. The slightly later Katha-upanishad, however, describes Vishnu in prominence - He who has no understanding, who is unmindful and always impure, never reaches that place, but enters into the round of births. But he who has understanding, who is mindful and always pure, reaches indeed that place, from whence he is not born again. But he who has understanding for his charioteer (intellect), and who holds the reins of the mind, he reaches the end of his journey, and that is the highest place of Vishnu. His rise to supremacy is apparent in the epics (Mahabharata, Ramayana, and from this period he may be considered a manifestation of the Singular God. Thus, according to this interpretation, the division in Hinduism of Vaishnavism and Shaivaism appeared only with the Puranas, where Vishnu's descents in ten principal Avatars become his distinguishing characteristic. In the Bhagavad Gita the avatara Krishna teaches Arjuna the nature of the Supreme being and the different processes of Yoga, ultimately culminating in devotional surrender:     Vishnu takes form as an all-inclusive deity, known as Purusha or ,  [Supreme Soul],  [In-dweller], and he is the Sheshin [Totality] in whom all souls are contained. He is Bhagavat or Bhagavan, which in Sanskrit means "possessing  (Divine Glory)". Vishnu possesses six such divine glories, namely, However, the actual number of auspicious qualities of Vishnu is countless, with the above-mentioned six qualities being the most important. Other important qualities attributed to Vishnu are Gambhirya (inestimatable grandeur), Audarya (generosity), and Karunya (compassion.) The Rigveda says: Vishnu can travel in three strides. The first stride is the Earth. The second stride is the visible sky. The third stride cannot be seen by men and is the heaven where the gods and the righteous dead live. (This feature of three strides also appears in the story of his avatar Vamana called Trivikrama.) The Sanskrit for "to stride" is the root kram; its reduplicated perfect tense is chakram ( grade) or chakra (zero-grade), and in the Rigveda he is called by epithets such as  = "he who has made 3 strides". The Sanskrit word chakra also means "wheel". That may have suggested the idea of Vishnu carrying a chakra. In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a school of Vaishnavism,  the Satvata-tantra describes three different forms, or aspects, of Vishnu as Maha Vishnu, Garbhodaksayi Vishnu and Kshirodakasayi Vishnu, with each form having a different role in the maintenance of the Universe and its inhabitants: "For material creation, Lord Krishna's plenary expansion assumes three Vishnus. The first one, Maha-Vishnu, creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodakasayi Vishnu, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, Kshirodakasayi Vishnu, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Paramatma. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vishnus can be liberated from material entanglement." Quoted from the Satvata-tantra translation by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada   In Sri Vaishnavism, another school, Vishnu assumes five forms: See also Pañcaratra Vishnu's consort is Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth. Maya is the samvit (the primary intelligence) of Vishnu, while the other five attributes emerge from this samvit and hence Maya is his ahamata, activity, or Vishnu's Power. This power of God, Maya, is personified and is called Maya, Vishnumaya, or Mahamaya, and She is said to manifest Herself in, 1) kriyāshakti, (Creative Activity) and 2) bhütishakti (Creation) of Universe. Hence this world cannot part with his creativity i.e., ahamta, which is a feminine form and is called Maya. Vishnu is also associated with Bhudevi or Prithvi, the earth goddess; Tulsi; Ganga, goddess of river Ganges and also Saraswati, goddess of learning. In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, verses 2.6.13-95 it is described that Vishnu has three wives, who constantly quarrel with each other, so that eventually, he keeps only Lakshmi, giving Ganga to Shiva and Saraswati to Brahma. Vishnu's vehicle is Garuda, the eagle, and he is commonly depicted as riding on his shoulders. Another name of him is "Veda-Atma" or The Soul of the Vedas and Vedic truth.  According to various Purana, Vishnu is the ultimate omnipresent reality, is shapeless and omnipresent. However, a strict iconography governs his representation, whether in pictures, icons, or idols:  Vishnu is always to be depicted holding the four attributes associated with him, being: To this may be added, conventionally, the vanamaala flower garland and Vishnu's bow, the Shaarnga, and his sword Nandaka. A verse of the Vishnu Sahasranama stotram states;"vanamālī gadhī shārngī shanki chakri cha nandaki / shrīmān nārāyaņo vişņo vāsudevo abhirakşatu//";   translation: Protect us Oh Lord Narayana who wears the forest garland,who has the mace, conch , sword and the wheel. And who is called Vishnu and the Vasudeva. In general, Vishnu is depicted in one of the following three ways:  There are ten avatars of Vishnu (dashavatara) commonly considered as the most prominent Garuda Purana Texts 1.86.10-11 : Dasavatara Page] (salagram.net) Some versions of the above list include Hayagriva amongst the Dasavataras. Apart from the above mentioned ten principal avatars, another 22 avatars are given in Chapter 3, Canto 1 of the Srimad Bhagavatam. Following this list the Bhagavatam states that as well as these avatars "the incarnations of the Lord are innumerable, like rivulets flowing from inexhaustible sources of water"Bhagvata Purana, 1.3.26. There has also been some comparison between the avatars of Vishnu and Darwin's Theory of Evolution, as the incarnations generally mirror increasing phylogenetic sophistication in keeping with the theory's proposal of terrestrial reptiles and mammals evolving from aquatic and amphibian life. http://mailerindia.com/god/hindu/index.php?vish6  Vishnu has a large number of names, collected in the Vishnu sahasranama ("Vishnu's thousand names") from within the larger work Mahabharata. The character Bhishma recites the names before Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, praising him (Vishnu) as the Supreme God. These Sahasranama are regarded as essence of all Vedas by followers of Vaishnavism who believe sincere chanting of Vishnu Sahasranama results in spiritual well-being and a greater awareness of God. The names are generally derived from the anantakalyanagunas (meaning: infinite auspicious attributes). Some names are:    sco:Vishnu simple:Vishnu sh:Višnu 10.082.06: The waters verily first retained the embryo in which all the gods were aggregated, single deposited on the navel of the unborn (creator), in which all beings abide. The reference to the navel of the unborn is an indication of reference to Vishnu. Agni is the lowest among devatas and Vishnu is the highest. All other devatas except Lord Vishnu and Agni Deva occupy positions between them. A similar view of Agni as the youngest deity and Vishnu as the oldest deity, in one interpretation, is even expressed in the Chamakam, the last lines in the famous Saivite Vedic hymn, Shri Rudram. "I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed."http://www.vedabase.net/bg/9/18/en1 .. the basis of everything, ..the eternal seed "But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe."http://www.vedabase.net/bg/10/42/en1 ..I pervade the entire universe "If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form."http://www.vedabase.net/bg/11/12/en1 ..effulgence of the Supreme Person.. "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not despair."http://www.vedabase.net/bg/18/66/en1 ..surrender unto Me..  Omniscient; defined as the power to know about all beings simultaneously; Aishvarya Sovereignty, which persist in unchallenged rule over all; Shakti Energy, or power, which is the capacity to make the impossible possible; Bala Strength, which is the capacity to support everything by his will and without any fatigue; Virya Vigour, or valour which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the Supreme Spirit or Being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations;  Resplendent, or Splendour, which expresses his self-sufficiency and the capacity to overpower everything by his spiritual effulgence; cited from Bhakti Schools of Vedanta, by Swami Tapasyananda. In the Para Form, Para is the highest form of Vishnu found only in Sri Vaikunta also called Moksha, along with his consorts Lakshmi, Bhuma Devi and Nila and surrounded by liberated souls like Ananta, Garuda, and a host of Muktas (liberated souls). In the Vyuha form which itself divides into four, Vishnu assumes four forms, which exercise different cosmic functions and controls activities of living beings. In the Vibhava form, Vishnu assume various manifestations, called Vibhavas, more popularily known as Avataras from time to time, in order to protect the virtuous, punish the evil-doers and re-establish righteousness. In the Antaryami; "Dwelling within" or "Suksma Vasudeva" form, Vishnu exists within the souls of all living beings and in every atom of matterhttp://sriranganatha.tripod.com/id49.html. In the Arcavatara or Image manifestation, the Lord is easily approachable to the devotees since they cannot worship Para, Vyuha, Vibhava and Antaryami forms directly, which can only be imagined or meditated upon because they are beyond our reach. Such images can be revealed by the Lord himself, for example, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam; or installed by devas or celestial beings such as Guruvayur Temple installed by Vayu; or installed by humans, and consecrated according to Vaishnava Agama shastras or scriptures such as Lord Jagannath of Jagannath Temple (Puri) at Puri.  He is to be depicted as a four-armed male-form: The four arms indicate his all-powerful and all-pervasive nature. The physical existence of Vishnu is represented by the two arms in the front while the two arms at the back represent his presence in the spiritual world. The Upanishad titled Gopal Uttartapani describes the four arms of Vishnu. The color of his skin has to be new-cloud-like-blue: The blue color indicates his all-pervasive nature, blue being the color of the infinite sky as well as the infinite ocean on which he resides. He has the mark of sage Bhrigu's feet on his chest. Also on his chest is the srivatsa mark, symbolising his consort Lakshmi. It is on the chest of Vishnu, where Lakshmi resides. Around his neck, he wears the auspicious "Kaustubha" jewel, and a garland of flowers (vanamaalaa). It is in this jewel, on Vishnu's chest that Lakshmi dwells. A crown should adorn his head: The crown symbolizes his supreme authority. He is to shown wearing two earrings: The earrings represent inherent opposites in creation - knowledge and ignorance; happiness and unhappiness; pleasure and pain. He rests on Ananta: the immortal and infinite snake A conch shell or Shankhya, named "Panchajanya", held by the upper left hand, which represents Vishnu's power to create and maintain the universe. The Panchajanya represents  the five elements or Panchabhoota - water, fire, air, earth and sky or space. It also represents the five airs or Pranas that are within the body and mind. The conch symbolizes that Vishnu is the primeval Divine sound of creation and universal maintainance. it also represented as Om. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna avatara states that of sound vibrations, 'He is Om'. The chakra, a sharp-spinning discus-like weapon, named "Sudarshana", held by the upper right hand, which symbolizes the purified spiritualized mind. The name Sudarshana is derived from two words - Su, which means good, superior, and Darshan, which means vision or Sight; together, it is "Superior Vision".  The chakra represents destruction of one's ego in the awakening and realization of the souls original nature and God, burning away of spiritual ignorance and illusion, and developing the higher spiritual vision and insight to realize God. A mace or Gada, named "Kaumodaki", held by the lower left hand,  symbolizes Vishnu's divine power is the source all spiritual, mental and physical strength. It also signifies Vishnu's power to destory materialistic or demoniac tendencies called anarthas; within the person's consciousness that hinders them from reaching God. Vishnu's mace is the power of the Divine within us to spiritually purify and uplift us from our materialistic bonds. A lotus flower or Padma, held by the lower right hand, represents  spiritual liberation, Divine perfection, purity and the unfolding of Spiritual consciousness within the individual. The lotus opening its petals in the light of the Sun is indicative of the expansion and awakening of our long dormant, original spiritual consciousness in the light of God. The lotus in Vishnu's hand symbolizes that God is the power and source from which the universe and the individual soul emerges. It represents Divine Truth or Satya, the originator of the rules of conduct or Dharma, and Divine vedic knowledge or jnana. The lotus also symbolizes that Vishnu is the embodiment of spiritual perfection and purity. Also that He is the wellspring of these qualities and that the individual soul must seek to awaken these intrinsic Divine qualities from Him by surrendering to and linking with Him. Standing upright on a lotus flower, often with Lakshmi, his consort, beside him on a similar pedestal; Reclining on the coiled-up thousand-hooded Shesha Naga, with his consort Lakshmi, seated at his feet; the assemblage rests on the "Kshira Sagar" (ocean of Milk). In this representation, Brahma is depicted as sitting on a lotus that grows out of Vishnu's navel. Riding on the back of his eagle mount, known as Garuda. Another name for Garuda is "Veda atma"; Soul of the Vedas. The flapping of his wings symbolizes the power of the Divine Truth of Vedic wisdom. Also the eagle represents the soul. Garuda carrying Vishnu symbolizes the soul or jiva atma carrying the Super soul or Param atma within it. Matsya, the fish. Kurma, the turtle. Varaha, the boar. Narasimha, the Man-Lion (Nara = man, simha = lion). Vamana, the Dwarf Brahmin (priest). Parashurama, Rama with the axe, who appeared in the Treta Yuga.
