  Dresden (etymologically from Old Sorbian Drežďany, meaning people of the riverside forest, Sorbian: Drježdźany) is the capital cityDesignated by article 2 of the Saxon Constitution of the German Federal Free State of Saxony. It is situated in a valley on the River Elbe. The Dresden conurbation is part of the Saxon Triangle metropolitan area.Region Sachsendreieck: Map of the Sachsendreieck (Saxon triangle) Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the Electors and Kings of Saxony, who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendour. The controversial bombing of Dresden in World War II by the British Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force, plus 40 years in the Soviet bloc state of the German Democratic Republic as well as contemporary city development changed the face of the city broadly. Considerable restoration work has settled the damage. Since German reunification in 1990, Dresden has emerged as a cultural, political, and economic centre in the eastern part of Germany.  Dresden lies on both banks of the river Elbe, mostly in the Dresden Elbe Valley Basin, with the further reaches of the eastern Ore Mountains to the south, the steep slope of the Lusatian granitic crust to the north, and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains to the east at an altitude of about 113 meters. The highest point of Dresden is about 384 meters in altitude.Dresden.de: Location, area, geographical data With a pleasant location and a mild climate on the E :LINKNUM:349
