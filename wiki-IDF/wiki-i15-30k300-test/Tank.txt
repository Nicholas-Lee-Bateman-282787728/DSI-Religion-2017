     A tank is a tracked armoured combat vehicle designed to engage enemies head-on, using direct and indirect fire from a large-calibre gun and supporting fire from machine guns. Heavy armour as well as a high degree of mobility give it protection, while the tracks allow it to cross even rough terrain at relatively high speeds. Tanks were invented and first manufactured for World War I in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, by the British Royal Navy, to break the deadlock of trench warfare.  A vehicle that could withstand machine-gun bullets and artillery shrapnel had the opportunity of reaching the enemy trench lines, suppressing or destroying enemy machine-gun nests and other strong-points.  The resulting breakthrough was then ideally to be followed up by deep penetration into enemy rear areas. Tanks seldom operate alone, being organised into armoured units, usually in combined arms forces. Without such support, tanks are vulnerable to special anti-tank artillery, other tanks, anti-tank mines, and (at short ranges) infantry, as well as specialised anti-tank aircraft. While tanks are expensive to operate and support, they remain among the most formidable and versatile weapons of the modern battlefield, both for their ability to engage other ground targets (including fortifications) and their shock value against infantry. Tanks and armour tactics have undergone many generations of evolution over nearly a century. Although weapons systems and armour continue to be developed, often at very :LINKNUM:344
