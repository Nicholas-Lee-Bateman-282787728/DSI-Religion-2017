    A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a list of instructions. Computers take numerous physical forms. The first devices that resemble modern computers date to the mid-20th century (around 1940 - 1945), although the computer concept and various machines similar to computers existed earlier. Early electronic computers were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers.In 1946, ENIAC consumed an estimated 174&nbsp;kW. By comparison, a typical personal computer may use around 400&nbsp;W; over four hundred times less.  Modern computers are based on comparatively tiny integrated circuits and are millions to billions of times more capable while occupying a fraction of the space.Early computers such as Colossus and ENIAC were able to process between 5 and 100 operations per second. A modern "commodity" microprocessor (as of 2007) can process billions of operations per second, and many of these operations are more complicated and useful than early computer operations. Today, simple computers may be made small enough to fit into a wristwatch and be powered from a watch battery. Personal computers in various forms are icons of the Information Age and are what most people think of as "a computer"; however, the most common form of computer in use today is the embedded computer.  Embedded computers are small, simple devices that are used to control other devices â€” for example, they may be found in machines ranging fr :LINKNUM:557
