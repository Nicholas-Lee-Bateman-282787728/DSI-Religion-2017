      Justine Henin (() (previously Justine Henin-Hardenne), (born June 1, 1982 in Li√®ge) is a Belgian professional tennis player.  She is currently ranked World No. 1. She has won 41 WTA singles titles and more than U.S.$19 million in prize money. Seven of those titles were Grand Slam singles titles, including four French Open titles (four of the last five and the last three, consecutively), one Australian Open title, and two U.S. Open titles.  She also has won the WTA Tour Championships twice and the singles gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Tennis experts cite her mental toughness, the completeness and variety of her game, her footspeed and footwork, and her one-handed backhand (which John McEnroe has described as the best single-handed backhand in the women's or men's game) as the principal reasons for her success. Henin has a very aggressive, yet highly versatile, all-court playing  style and can hit all the fundamental shots to an extremely high level of  technical proficiency. Henin plays with a rare combination of power and finesse that allows for her success on all surfaces.  Consequently, Henin's playing style is one of the most admired in tennis: John McEnroe has  described Henin's tennis as "Federertennis", frequently describing  Henin as 'the Roger Federer of women's tennis' (BBC commentaries and  studio interviews, Wimbledon 2005, 2006, 2007). At Roland Garros 2007,  Martina Navratilova said that "Henin's offense is just phenomenal... it's  sort of like we :LINKNUM:622
