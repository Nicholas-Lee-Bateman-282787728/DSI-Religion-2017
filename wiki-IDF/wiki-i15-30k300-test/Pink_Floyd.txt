After Barrett's departure, singer and bass player Roger Waters gradually became the dominant and driving force in the mid-1970s, until his eventual departure from the group in 1985. The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979).  In 1985, Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct, but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring as Pink Floyd.
