     Louis XIV (baptised as Louis-Dieudonn√©) (September 5, 1638 &ndash; September 1, 1715) ruled as King of France and of Navarre. He acceded to the throne on May 14 1643, a few months before his fifth birthday, but did not assume actual personal control of the government until the death of his First Minister ("premier ministre"), the Italian Jules Cardinal Mazarin, in 1661. Louis would remain on the throne till his death just prior to his seventy-seventh birthday in 1715. The reign of Louis XIV spanned seventy-two years and three months, the longest of any European monarch and the second-longest documented reign of any monarch since antiquity. Only Sobhuza II of Swaziland had a longer precisely documented reign (1899-1982). Louis XIV is known as Louis the Great (in French Louis le Grand or Le Grand Monarque, "the Great Monarch"), after the Parlement de Paris,  following the victory of the Franco-Dutch War and the Treaty of Nijmegen, decreed that all public inscriptions and statues of the king should carry that epithet. He is also known as The Sun King (in French Le Roi Soleil) because it was thought that, just as the planets revolve around the Sun, so too should France and the Court revolve around him. As a result, he was associated with Apollo  Helios, the Greco-Roman god of the Sun. This is also fitting because, as patron of the Arts, Louis was, like Apollo Musagetes, the "leader of the Muses". During that period of time he increased the power and influence of France in Eu :LINKNUM:462
