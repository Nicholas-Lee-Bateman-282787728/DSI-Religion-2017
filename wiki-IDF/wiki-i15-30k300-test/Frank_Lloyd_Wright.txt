 Frank Lloyd Wright (June 8 1867 &ndash; April 9 1959) was an American  architect, interior designer, writer, educator, and philosopher from Oak Park, Illinois. He designed more than 1,000 projects, of which more than 500 resulted in completed works.  Wright promoted organic architecture (exemplified by Fallingwater), originated the Prairie School of architecture (exemplified by the Robie House), and developed the concept of the Usonian home (exemplified by the Rosenbaum House). His work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including offices, churches, schools, hotels, and museums.  Wright also often designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass. Wright authored twenty books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. His colorful personal life frequently made headlines, most notably for the failure of his first two marriages and for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio. Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as "the greatest American architect of all time". Frank Lloyd Wright was born in the agricultural town of Richland Center, Wisconsin, United States, just two years after the end of the American Civil War. Originally named Frank Lincoln Wright, he changed his name after his parents' divorce to honor his mother's Welsh immigrant family, the Lloyd Joneses. His fat :LINKNUM:336
