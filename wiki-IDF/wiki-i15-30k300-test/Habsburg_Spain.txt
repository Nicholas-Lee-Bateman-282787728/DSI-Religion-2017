  Habsburg Spain refers to the history of Spain over the 16th and 17th centuries (1516-1700), when this country was ruled by the Habsburg dynasty (also associated to its role in the history of Central Europe). Under Habsburg rule (chiefly under Charles I of Spain and Philip II of Spain), Spain reached the zenith of its influence and power, controlling territory ranging from the Philippines in Asia (named after Philip II) to the Low Countries and large areas of present day Italy in Europe, along with its American colonies. Altogether, Habsburg Spain was, for a time, the world's greatest power. For this reason, this period of Spanish history has also been referred to as the "Age of Expansion". Still, under the latter Habsburg kings, Spain also began its slow decline from its previous flush. Spain's 16th century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the Ottomans at Lepanto in 1571 (which was symbolically important to the Spanish), and then after the setback of the Spanish Armada in 1588, in a series of victories against England in the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585â€“1604. However during the middle decades of the 17th century Habsburg Spain's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the United Provinces. On land Habsburg Spain became embroiled in the vast Thirty Years' War, and in the second half of the 17th century the Spanish were defeated by the French, led by King Louis XIV. Habsburg rule came to an end in Spain with the death in 1700  :LINKNUM:369
