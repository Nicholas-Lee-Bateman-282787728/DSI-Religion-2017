   The Big Bang is a cosmological model of the universe that has become well supported by several independent observations. After Edwin Hubble discovered that galactic distances were generally proportional to their redshifts in 1929, this was taken to indicate that the universe is expanding. If the universe is seen to be expanding, then it must have been smaller, denser, and hotter in the past. This idea has been considered in detail all the way back to extreme densities and temperatures, and the resulting conclusions have been found to conform very closely to what is observed. The term 'Big Bang' was first coined by Fred Hoyle, ironically, in a derisory statement seeking to belittle the credibility of the theory which he did not believe to be true.[ ] However, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964 was taken as almost undeniable support for the Big Bang. Analysis of the spectrum of light from galaxies reveals a shift towards longer wavelengths proportional to each galaxy's distance in a relationship described by Hubble's law, which is taken to indicate that space-time is undergoing a continuous expansion. Furthermore, the accidental discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 suggests that the universe has cooled from an initial hot, dense state as a result of the expansion of space-time. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background led to general acceptance among physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists that the Big Bang describes th :LINKNUM:386
