   Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina. It is located on the southern shore of the Río de la Plata, on the southeastern coast of the South American continent. Greater Buenos Aires, which includes the adjacent partidos or municipalities, constitutes the third largest conurbation in Latin America, with 13 million inhabitants. After the internal conflicts of the 19th century, Buenos Aires was federalised and removed from Buenos Aires Province in 1880; its city limits were enlarged to include the former towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighbourhoods in the city.   Buenos Aires (, ) was originally named after the sanctuary of "Nostra Signora di Bonaria" (Italian for "Our Lady of Good Air", also known as "Virgine de Bonaria") located in Cagliari, Sardinia. Argentines sometimes refer to the city as Capital Federal to differentiate the city from the province of the same name. In the 1994 constitution, the city was given autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires. The abbreviations Bs. As. and Baires are sometimes used, the first one mostly in writing and the latter in everyday speech. The city is sometimes called La Reina del Plata, that is, "The Queen of the Plata" (a reference to the Plata river basin).   Seaman Juan Díaz de Solís, navigating in the name of Spain, was the first European to reach the Río de la Plata, in 1516, but his expedition was cut short by an attack in which he was killed by the native Charrúa tribe, in tod :LINKNUM:516
