 Computers can be separated into software and hardware. Computing hardware is the physical machine that, under the direction of a program, stores and manipulates data.   Originally, calculations were done by humans, who were called computers, as a job title.   This article covers major developments in the history of computing hardware, and attempts to put them in context.  For a detailed timeline of events, see the computing timeline article.  The history of computing article treats methods intended for pen and paper, with or without the aid of tables. Since digital computers rely on digital storage, and tend to be limited by the size and speed of memory, the history of computer data storage is tied to the development of computers.       Humanity has used devices to aid in computation for millennia. The earliest counting device was probably some form of tally stick; later record keeping aids include Phoenician clay shapes which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, in containers. A more arithmetic-oriented machine is the abacus. The earliest form of abacus, the dust abacus, had been used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented, for example in a medieval counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money. A number of analog computers were constructed in ancient and medieval time :LINKNUM:393
