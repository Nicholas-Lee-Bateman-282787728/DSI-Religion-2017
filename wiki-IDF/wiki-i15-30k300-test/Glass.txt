   Glass in the common sense refers to a hard, brittle, transparent solid, such as used for windows, many bottles, or eyewear, including soda-lime glass, acrylic glass, sugar glass, isinglass (Muscovy-glass), or aluminium oxynitride. In the technical sense, glass is an inorganic product of fusion which has been cooled to a rigid condition without crystallizing.ASTM definition of glass from 1945; also: DIN 1259, Glas - Begriffe f√ºr Glasarten und Glasgruppen, September 1986Zallen, The Physics of Amorphous Solids, John Wiley, New York, (1983).Cusack, The physics of structurally disordered matter: an introduction, Adam Hilger in association with the University of Sussex press (1987)Elliot, Physics of amorphous materials, Longman group ltd (1984)Horst Scholze: "Glass - Nature, Structure, and Properties"; Springer, 1991, ISBN 0-387-97396-6 Most glasses contain silica as their main component and glass former.Werner Vogel: "Glass Chemistry"; Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH & Co. K; 2nd revised edition (November 1994), ISBN 3540575723 In the scientific sense the term glass is often extended to all amorphous solids (and melts that easily form amorphous solids), including plastics, resins, or other silica-free amorphous solids. In addition, besides traditional melting techniques, any other means of preparation are considered, such as ion implantation, and the sol-gel method. However, glass science commonly includes only inorganic amorphous solids, while plastics and similar o :LINKNUM:450
