   Manitoba (English ; French ) is one of Canada's 10 provinces, with a population of 1,190,400 (2007). It was officially recognized by the Federal Government in 1870 as separate from the Northwest Territories, and became the first Province created from the Territories. It is the easternmost of the three Prairie Provinces.  The word "Manitoba" is etymologically related to the native word "manitou" which means spirit.  Manitoba, in the Red River area, contained the first western colony and settlement area of Canada.  Manitoba is the only Canadian Province with an Arctic deep water sea port at Churchill, along Hudson Bay.

Its capital and largest city (containing over half the provincial population) is Winnipeg, with a population of approx. 710,000 (winnipeg capitol region). Other cities with more than 10,000 people are Brandon, Thompson, Portage la Prairie, and Steinbach. A person from Manitoba is called a Manitoban.
