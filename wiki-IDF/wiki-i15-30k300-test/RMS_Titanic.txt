     The RMS Titanic was a British Olympic-class ocean liner, owned by the White Star Line, that struck an iceberg on April 14 1912 and sank on the morning of April 15 1912 during her maiden voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to New York. Estimates vary, but approximately 1,520 people perished in the sinking which ranks as one of the worst peacetime maritime disasters in history. The resulting media frenzy, the discovery of the wreck in 1985, and the box office successes of three major films and one broadway musical have perpetuated the fame. The great loss of life resulted in improved safety standards at sea, and affected many aspects of maritime law. In the early part of the 20th century, White Star Line was competing with rival Cunard Line, which dominated the luxury niche for Atlantic transit with the large and opulent vessels Lusitania and Mauretania, the largest and fastest liners afloat. White Star ordered three ships to provide a weekly express service, with the goal of dominating the transatlantic travel business. The Olympic and Titanic at 882 feet long were larger, but not as fast as the Cunard liners. The third ship was slightly larger and delivered later due to the modifications after the loss of the Titanic, the Gigantic was renamed prior to launching to HMHS Britannic. These larger ships offered greater amenities than the Cunard sister ships. Built at Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, Titanic was designed by Harland and Wolff Chairman William Pirrie :LINKNUM:337
