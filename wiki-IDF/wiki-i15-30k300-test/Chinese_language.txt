 Chinese or the Sinitic language(s) (汉语/漢語, pinyin: Hànyǔ; 中文, pinyin: Zhōngwén) can be considered a language or a language family and is originally the indigenous languages spoken by the Han Chinese in China. It forms one of the two branches of Sino-Tibetan family of languages.*David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987) , p. 312. “The mutual unintelligibility of the varieties is the main ground for referring to them as separate languages.” Spoken Chinese is distinguished by its high level of internal diversity, though all spoken varieties of Chinese are tonal and analytic. There are between six and twelve main regional groups of Chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most populous (by far) is Mandarin (c. 850&nbsp;million), followed by Wu (c. 90&nbsp;million), Min (c. 70&nbsp;million) and Cantonese (c. 70&nbsp;million). Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, though some, like Xiang and the Southwest Mandarin dialects, may share common terms and some degree of intelligibility. Chinese is classified as a macrolanguage with thirteen sub-languages in ISO 639-3, though the identification of the varieties of Chinese as multiple "languages" or as "dialects" of a single language is a contentious issue. The standardized form of spoken Chinese is Standard Mandarin "普通话/普通話 (pinyin: pǔtōnghùa); 国语/國語 (pinyin: gúoyǔ)", based on the Beijing dialect. Standard Mandarin is the official language of the Pe :LINKNUM:410
