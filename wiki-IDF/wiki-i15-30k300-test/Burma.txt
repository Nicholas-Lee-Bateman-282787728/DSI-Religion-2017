   Burma, officially the Union of Myanmar (Burmese: , ), is the largest country by geographical area in mainland Southeast Asia. The country achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 4 January 1948, as the "Union of Burma." It became the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" on 4 January 1974, before reverting to the "Union of Burma" on 23 September 1988. On 18 June 1989, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SPDC) adopted the name "Union of Myanmar".  This controversial name change was not recognized by SPDC opposition groups and many English-speaking nations. The country is bordered by China on the north, Laos on the east, Thailand on the southeast, Bangladesh on the west, and India on the northwest, with the Bay of Bengal to the southwest. One-third of Burma's total perimeter, 1,930 kilometres (1,199 mi), forms an uninterrupted coastline.

Its political system remains under the tight control of the State Peace and Development Council, the military led government, since 1992, by Senior General Than Shwe.
