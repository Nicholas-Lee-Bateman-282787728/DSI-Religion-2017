 Tasmania is an Australian island and state of the same name. It is located 240 kilometres (150&nbsp;mi) south of the eastern side of the continent, being separated from it by Bass Strait.  The state of Tasmania includes the island of Tasmania, and other surrounding islands.  Tasmania has an estimated population of 493,300 as of June 2007Australian Demographic Statistics, Jun 2007, ABS and an area of 68,401 square kilometres (26,410&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Tasmania promotes itself as the Natural State and the "Island of Inspiration" owing to its large, and relatively unspoiled natural environment.  Formally, almost 37% of Tasmania is in reserves, National Parks and World Heritage Sites.  The island is 364 kilometres long from the northernmost point to the southernmost point, and 306 kilometres from west to east. The state capital and largest city is Hobart, which encompasses the local government areas of City of Hobart, City of Glenorchy and City of Clarence.  Other major population centres include Launceston in the north, and Devonport and Burnie in the northwest. The subantarctic Macquarie Island is also under the administration of the state, as part of the Huon Valley Council local government area. It is believed that the island was joined to the mainland until the end of the most recent ice age approximately 10,000 years ago. Much of the island is composed of Jurassic dolerite intrusions (upwellings of magma) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar crystals.  :LINKNUM:493
