   A fungus () is any eukaryotic organism that is a member of the kingdom Fungi ().These are the pronunciations listed first in most dictionaries. See, for example, the Merriam-Webster Online entry Alternative pronunciations for fungi include /ˈfʌŋgaɪ/, /ˈfʌndʒi/, and /ˈfʌŋgi/. Funguses (/ˈfʌŋgəsəz/) is an alternative plural form. The fungi are heterotrophic organisms characterized by a chitinous cell wall, and in the majority of species, filamentous growth as multicellular hyphae forming a mycelium; some fungal species also grow as single cells. Sexual and asexual reproduction is commonly via spores, often produced on specialized structures or in fruiting bodies. Some fungal species have lost the ability to form specialized reproductive structures, and propagate solely by vegetative growth. Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are examples of fungi. The fungi are a monophyletic group that is phylogenetically clearly distinct from the morphologically similar slime molds (myxomycetes) and water molds (oomycetes). The fungi are more closely related to animals than plants, yet the discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi, known as mycology, often falls under a branch of botany. Occurring worldwide, most fungi are largely invisible to the naked eye, living for the most part in soil, dead matter and as symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi. They perform an essential role in all ecosystems in decomposing matter and are indispensable in nutrient cycling and exchange. Some  :LINKNUM:497
