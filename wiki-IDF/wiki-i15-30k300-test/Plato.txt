 Plato (Greek: , Plátōn, "wide, broad-browed"Diogenes Laertius 3.4) (424/423 BC – 348/347 BC), was a Classical Greek philosopher, who together with his teacher, Socrates, and his student, Aristotle, helped to lay the philosophical foundations of Western culture. Plato was also a mathematician, writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the western world. Plato was originally a student of Socrates, and was as much influenced by his thinking as by what he saw as his teacher's unjust death. Plato's brilliance as a writer and thinker can be witnessed by reading his Socratic dialogues. Some of the dialogues, letters, and other works that are ascribed to him are considered spurious.Some were already excluded from Thrasyllus' tetralogies (see below); for a typical modern view of which other works in the Platonic corpus are spurious or dubious, see e.g. the classification of works as authentic, dubious, or spurious in the table of contents to John M. Cooper (ed.), Plato: Complete Works, Hackett, 1997.  Interestingly, although there is little question that Plato lectured at the Academy that he founded, the pedagogical function of his dialogues, if any, is not known with certainty. The dialogues have since Plato's time been used to teach a range of subjects, mostly including philosophy, logic, rhetoric, mathematics, and other subjects about which he wrote. The exact birthdate of Plato is unknown.  Based on ancien :LINKNUM:439
