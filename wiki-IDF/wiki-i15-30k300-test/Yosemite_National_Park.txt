    Yosemite National Park (pronounced "yo-SEM-it-ee", ) is a national park located largely in Mariposa and Tuolumne Counties, California, United States. The park covers an area of 761,266&nbsp;acres or 1,189&nbsp;square miles (3,081&nbsp;km²) and reaches across the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain chain.Harris, Geology of National Parks (5th ed), p. 324. Yosemite is visited by over 3.5 million people each year, many of whom only spend time in the seven square miles (18&nbsp;km²) of Yosemite Valley. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its spectacular granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, Giant Sequoia groves, and biological diversity. About 89% of the park is designated wilderness. Although not the first designated national park, Yosemite was a focal point in the development of the national park idea, largely owing to the work of people like John Muir. Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals. The park has an elevation range from 2,000 to 13,114&nbsp;feet (600 to 4,000&nbsp;m) and contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral/oak woodland, lower montane, upper montane, subalpine, and alpine. Of California's 7,000 plant species, about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% within Yosemite. There is suitable habitat or documentation for more than 160 rare plants in the park, with rare local geologic :LINKNUM:421
