   An airship or dirigible is a lighter than air (buoyant) aircraft that can be steered and propelled through the air using rudders and propellers. Unlike other aerodynamic aircraft such as fixed-wing aircraft (airplanes) and helicopters, which produce lift by moving a wing or airfoil through the air, aerostatic aircraft, such as airships and hot air balloons, stay aloft by filling a large cavity, such as a balloon, with a lighter than air gas. The main types of airship are Non-rigid airships (or blimps), semi-rigid airships and rigid airships. Blimps are small airships without internal skeletons. Semi-rigid airships are slightly larger and have some form of internal support such as a fixed keel. Rigid airships with a full skeleton, such as the massive Zeppelin transoceanic models, are now a thing of the past. Airships were the first aircraft to make controlled, powered flight.  They were widely used before the 1940s. Their use decreased over time as their capabilities were surpassed by those of airplanes.  Their decline furthered with a series of high-profile accidents, including the 1937 burning of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg near Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Airships are still used today in certain niche applications, such as advertising and as a camera platform for sporting events. In many countries, airships are also known as dirigibles from the French (dirigir to direct plus -ible), meaning "directable" or steerable.  The first airships were called dirigible balloons.
