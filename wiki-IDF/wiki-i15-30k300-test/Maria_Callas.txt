  Maria Callas (Greek: Μαρία Κάλλας) (December 2, 1923 &ndash; September 16, 1977) was an American-born Greek operatic soprano during World War II and in the post-war period.  She combined an impressive bel canto technique with great dramatic gifts.  An extremely versatile singer, her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti, Bellini, and Rossini, and further, to the works of Verdi and Puccini, and in her early career, the music dramas of Wagner.  Her remarkable musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed La Divina. Born in New York and raised by an overbearing mother, she received her musical education in Greece and established her career in Italy.  Forced to deal with the exigencies of wartime poverty and with myopia that left her nearly blind on stage, she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career.  She turned herself from a heavy woman into a glamorous one after a mid-career weight loss, which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career.  The press exulted in publicizing Callas’s allegedly temperamental behavior, her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi, and her love affair with Aristotle Onassis.  Her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press. Her artistic achievements, however, were such that Leonard Bernstein called her "The Bible of opera","PBS tribute to Callas on the Anniversary of her Death", introduction by :LINKNUM:525
