    The Arabic alphabet is the script used for writing languages such as Arabic,  Persian, Urdu, and others.  Arabic is written from right to left, and is written in a cursive style of script.  There are 28 basic letters in the Arabic alphabet.   Just as different handwriting styles and typefaces exist in the Roman alphabet, there are Arabic scripts in a number of different Arabic calligraphy styles, including Naskh, , Shahmukhi, , Thuluth, Kufic, and  Hejazi.  After the Latin alphabet, the Arabic writing system is the second-most widely used alphabet around the world. The alphabet was first used to write texts in Arabic â€” most importantly, the , the holy book of Islam. With the spread of Islam, it came to be used to write many other languages, even outside of the Semitic family to which Arabic belongs.  Examples of non-Semitic languages written with the Arabic alphabet include Persian, Urdu, Pashto, Baloch, Malay, Balti, Brahui, Panjabi (in Pakistan), Kashmiri, Sindhi (in Pakistan), Uyghur (in China), Kazakh (in China), Kyrgyz (in China), Azerbaijani (in Iran) and Kurdish in Iraq and Iran. In order to accommodate the needs of these other languages, new letters and other symbols were added to the original alphabet. (See Arabic alphabets of other languages below.) The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 basic letters. Adaptations of Arabic script for other languages, such the Malay Arabic script, may have additional letters. There are no distinct upper and lower case letter forms.  :LINKNUM:378
