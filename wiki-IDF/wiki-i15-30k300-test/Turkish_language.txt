 Turkish ( IPA ) is a language spoken by 95–110 million people worldwide, making it the most commonly spoken of the Turkic languages.  Its speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller ranges in North Cyprus, Bulgaria, and other parts of Eastern Europe.  Turkish is also spoken  by several million immigrants in Western Europe, particularly in Germany. The roots of the language can be traced to Siberia and Mongolia (Inner Asia), with the first written records dating back nearly 1,200 years. To the west, the influence of Ottoman Turkish—the immediate precursor of today's Turkish—spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded. In 1928, as one of Atatürk's Reforms in the early years of the new Turkish Republic, the Ottoman script was replaced with a phonetic variant of the Latin alphabet. Concurrently, the newly-founded Turkish Language Association initiated a drive to reform the language by removing Persian and Arabic loanwords in favor of native variants and coinages from Turkic roots. The distinctive characteristics of Turkish are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination. The basic word order of Turkish is Subject Object Verb. Turkish has a T-V distinction: second-person plural forms can be used for individuals as a sign of respect. Turkish also has no noun classes or grammatical gender. Turkish is a member of the Turkish, or Western, subgroup of the Oghuz languages, which includes Gagauz and Azeri. The Oghuz languages form the Southwestern subgroup of the Turkic languages :LINKNUM:316
