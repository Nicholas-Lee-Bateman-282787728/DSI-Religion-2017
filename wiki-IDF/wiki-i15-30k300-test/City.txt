     A city is an urban settlement with a particularly important status which differentiates it from a town. City is primarily used to designate an urban settlement with a large population. However, city may also indicate a special administrative, legal, or historical status. In the United States, "city" is primarily a legal term meaning an urban area with a degree of autonomy (i.e. a township), rather than meaning an entire large settlement (metropolitan area). Outside the United States, "city" implies an entire settlement or metropolitan area, although there are notable exceptions, e.g. the City of London. In the United Kingdom, a city is a settlement with a charter ("letters patent") from the Crown, giving that settlement city status. Present-day cities are products of the industrial revolution and are generally distinguished by land area and population. Large, industrialized cities generally have advanced organizational systems for sanitation, utilities, land distribution, housing, and transportation. In economic terms, a city is simply defined as the absence of physical space between people and firms. This close proximity greatly facilitates interaction between people and firms, benefiting both parties in the process. However, there is debate now whether the age of technology and instantaneous communication with the use of the internet are making cities obsolete. A big city, or metropolis, is usually accompanied by a subcity; for example, Aurora, Colorado is a subcity of :LINKNUM:315
