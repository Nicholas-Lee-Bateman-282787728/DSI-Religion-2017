   Water is a common chemical substance that is essential to all known forms of known life.http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/bichaw/1997/36/i43/abs/bi971323j.html In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor. About 1,460 teratonnes&nbsp;(Tt) of water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds (formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and precipitation. Water Vapor in the Climate System, Special Report, [AGU], December 1995 (linked 4/2007). Vital Water UNEP. Some of the Earth's water is contained within man-made and natural objects near the Earth's surface such as water towers, animal and plant bodies, manufactured products, and food stores. Saltwater oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers and lakes 0.6%. Water moves continually through a cycle of evaporation or transpiration (evapotranspiration), precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 36&nbsp;Tt per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 71&nbsp;Tt per year to the precipitation of 107&nbsp;Tt per year over land. Some water is trapped for varying periods in ice caps, glaciers, aquifers, or  :LINKNUM:685
