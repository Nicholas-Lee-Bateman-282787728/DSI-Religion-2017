  The Iowa-class was a planned class of six battleships ordered by the United States Navy in 1939 and 1940 to escort the Fast Carrier Task Forces that would operate in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. Four were completed in the early to mid-1940s; two more were laid down, canceled prior to completion, and ultimately scrapped. They comprised the final class of U.S. battleships to be built.At the time the Montana class battleships were being planned, but none of those ships were laid down. Built with no regard for cost, the Iowa class was arguably the ultimate in the evolution of the capital ship.Although it is frequently cited as the ultimate battleship class, other battleship classes did outclass the Iowas in certain fields; for example, the Imperial Japanese Navy's Yamato-class battleships had larger guns ( and more armor than the Iowaâ€™s.
