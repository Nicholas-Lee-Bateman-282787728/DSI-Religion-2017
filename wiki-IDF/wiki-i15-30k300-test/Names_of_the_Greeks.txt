Alexander the Great is the first commander who officially uses the terms Hellas and Panhellenic League (league of all Greek tribes except for the Lacedaemonians) when he declares the beginning of his military campaign against the Persian ruler of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor (Ionia) in order to take revenge on behalf of their ancestors.
