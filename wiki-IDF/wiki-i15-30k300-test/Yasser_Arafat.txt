   Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini () (August 4, 1929 – November 11, 2004), popularly known as Yasser Arafat, was a Palestinian leader. As Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and President of the Palestinian National Authority,Some sources use the term Chairman rather than President; the Arabic word for both titles is the same. See President of the Palestinian National Authority for further information. Arafat continuously fought against the Israelis in the name of Palestinian self-determination. He spent much of his life leading the secular Fatah political party, which he founded between 1958 and 1960. Originally opposed to Israel's existence, he modified his position in 1988 when he accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242. Arafat was constantly surrounded by controversy, as in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Fatah faced off with Jordan in a civil war. Forced out of Jordan and into Lebanon, Arafat and Fatah were the targets of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions of that country. The majority of the Palestinian people — regardless of political ideology or faction — viewed him as a freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized their national aspirations, while many Israelis have described him as a terrorist for the many attacks his faction led against civilians. Later in his career, Arafat engaged in a series of negotiations with the government of Israel to end the decades-long conflict between that country and the PLO. These inclu :LINKNUM:470
