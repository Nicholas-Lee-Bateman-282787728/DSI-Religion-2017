Navratilova)", Alastair Campbell, The Times, July 3 2004"When he was king", Tim Pears, The Observer, June 5 2005 During a nine-year career, Borg won 41 percent of the Grand Slam singles tournaments he entered (11 of 27) and 89.8 percent of the Grand Slam singles matches he played. Both are male open era records. In addition, Borg's six French Open singles titles are an all-time record."Compare and contrast", Jon Wertheim, Sports Illustrated, September 23 2002"Borg still making the shots", Douglas Robson, USA Today, May 25 2006 He is the only player in the open era to have won both Wimbledon and the French Open in the same year more than once, as he won both in three consecutive years. As a child growing up in Södertälje, a town near Stockholm, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racquet that his father won at a table-tennis tournament. His father gave him the racquet, beginning one of the brightest careers in tennis history. In 1972, at the age of 15, Borg became one of the youngest players ever to represent his country in the Davis Cup and won his debut singles rubber in five sets against seasoned professional Onny Parun of New Zealand.
