 The term race refers to the concept of dividing people into populations or groups on the basis of various sets of characteristics.AAPA Statement on Biological Aspects of Race American Association of Physical Anthropologists "Pure races do not exist in the human species today, nor is there any evidence that they have ever existed in the past." The most widely used human racial categories are based on visible traits (especially skin color, cranial or facial features and hair texture), and self-identification. Bamshad, Michael and Steve E. Olson. "Does Race Exist?", Scientific American Magazine (10 November 2003). Conceptions of race, as well as specific ways of grouping races, vary by culture and over time, and are often controversial for scientific as well as social and political reasons. The controversy ultimately revolves around whether or not races are natural types or socially constructed, and the degree to which observed differences in ability and achievement, categorized on the basis of race, are a product of inherited (i.e. genetic) traits or environmental, social and cultural factors. Some argue that although "race" is a valid taxonomic concept in other species, it cannot be applied to humans.S O Y Keita, R A Kittles, C D M Royal, G E Bonney, P Furbert-Harris, G M Dunston & C N Rotimi, 2004 "Conceptualizing human variation" in Nature Genetics  36, S17 - S20 Conceptualizing human variation  Many scientists have argued that race definitions are imprecise, arbitrary, der :LINKNUM:431
