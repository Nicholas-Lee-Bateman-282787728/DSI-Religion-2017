 The Temptations (abbreviated as "The Temps") are an  American African American male song and dance group who achieved fame as one of the pioneer bands who created a musical genre called the Motown Sound by combining R&B, doo-wop, funk, disco, soul, and adult contemporary music. Formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1960 as The Elgins, the Temptations have always featured five African American male vocalists/dancers.  The group, known for its recognizable choreography, distinct harmonies, and onstage suits, has been said to be as influential to soul as the Beatles are to rock.Graff, Gary (1988-08-29).
