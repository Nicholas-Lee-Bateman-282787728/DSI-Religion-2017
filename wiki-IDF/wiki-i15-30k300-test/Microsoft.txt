One of Bill Gates' key visions is "to get a workstation running our software onto every desk and eventually in every home".Quote from ComputerWorld 1985 (7/22); there is as yet no documented use of this vision statement prior to 1985. Gates' official bio asserts that he was 'Guided by a belief that the computer would be a valuable tool on every office desktop and in every home'. Founded to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s. The company released an initial public offering (IPO) in the stock market, which, due to the ensuing rise of the stock price, has made four billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.Chapman, Merrill R., In search of stupidity: over 20 years of high :LINKNUM:410
