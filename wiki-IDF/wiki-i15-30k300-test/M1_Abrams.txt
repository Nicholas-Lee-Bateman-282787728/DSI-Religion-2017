   The M1 Abrams is a military tank produced in the United States. The M1 is named after General Creighton Abrams, former Army Chief of Staff and commander of the 37th Armored Regiment. It is a main battle tank, the well armed, heavily armored, and highly mobile offensive mainstay of modern armored ground warfare.  Notable features of the M1 Abrams include the use of a powerful gas turbine engine, the adoption of sophisticated composite armor, and separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment for crew safety.  It is one of the heaviest tanks in service. The M1 Abrams entered U.S. service in 1980, replacing the M60 Patton and M48A5. It did, however, serve for over a decade alongside the improved M60A3, which had entered service in 1978.  Three main versions of the M1 Abrams have been deployed, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, incorporating improved armament, protection and electronics.  These improvements, as well as periodic upgrades to older tanks have allowed this long-serving vehicle to remain in front-line service.  It is the principal combat tank of the United States Army and the Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and as of 2007, Australia. The first attempt to replace the aging M60 series of tanks was the abortive MBT-70, developed in partnership with West Germany. The M60 Patton was itself a gradual evolution of a design starting with the World War II era M26 Pershing, with a very tall profile, and average armor and weapon compared to the conte :LINKNUM:312
