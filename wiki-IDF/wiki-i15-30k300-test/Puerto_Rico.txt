   Puerto Rico, officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( [literally, ]), is a semi-autonomous territory of the United States located in the northeastern Caribbean, east of the Dominican Republic and west of the Virgin Islands.  The territory is composed of an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands and keys the largest of which are Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. The main island of Puerto Rico is the smallest by land area but third largest by population among the four Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico). Puerto Ricans sometimes call the island Borinquen, from the old Taíno language Borikén . Allatson, Paul. Key Terms in Latino/a Cultural and Literary Studies, p. 47.
