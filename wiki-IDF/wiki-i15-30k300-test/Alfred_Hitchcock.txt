    Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock KBE (August 13 1899&nbsp;&ndash; April 29 1980) was an iconic and highly influential director and producer who pioneered many techniques in the suspense and thriller genres. After a substantial film career in his native Britain, he moved to Hollywood and became an American citizen with dual nationality in 1956, thus he also remained a British subject. Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades, from the silent film era, through the invention of talkies, to the colour era. He was among the most consistently recognizable directors to the general public, and was one of the most successful film directors during his lifetime. He continues to be one of the best known and most popular filmmakers of all time. Hitchcock became famous for his expert and largely unrivalled control of pace and suspense, and his films draw heavily on both fear and fantasy.

Hitchcock began his directing career in the United Kingdom in 1922. From 1939 onward, he worked primarily in the United States. In September, 1940, Hitchcock had purchased a  mountaintop estate for the sum of $40,000. Known as the 1870 Cornwall Ranch or "Heart o' the Mountain" which was located at the end of Canham Road. The Ranch was perched high above Scotts Valley, California, and the H :LINKNUM:424
