  The History of Buddhism spans from the 6th century BCE to the present, starting with the birth of the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama. This makes it one of the oldest religions practiced today. Throughout this period, the religion evolved as it encountered various countries and cultures, adding to its original Indian foundation Central Asian, East Asian, and Southeast Asian, and to a lesser extent Hellenistic cultural elements. In the process, its geographical extent became considerable so as to affect at one time or another most of the Asian continent. The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements and schisms, foremost among them the Theravada, Mahāyāna and Vajrayana traditions, punctuated by contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.  According to the Buddhist tradition, the historical Buddha Siddharta Gautama was born to the  Shakya clan, at the beginning of the Magadha period (546&ndash;324 BCE), in the plains of Lumbini in Ancient India. He is also known as the Shakyamuni (literally "The sage of the Shakya clan"). After an early life of luxury under the protection of his father, Śuddhodana, the ruler of Kapilavastu (later to be incorporated into the state of  Magadha), Siddharta entered into contact with the realities of the world and concluded that real life was about inescapable suffering and sorrow. Siddharta renounced his meaningless life of luxury to become an ascetic. He ultimately decided that asceticism was also meaningless :LINKNUM:545
