     The Polish-Muscovite War (1605–1618) took place in the early-seventeenth century (between 1605 and 1618) as a row of military conflicts and eastward invasions carried by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, or the private armies and mercenaries led by the magnates (the Commonwealth aristorcracy), when the Russian Tsardom was torn into a series of civil wars, the time most commonly referred in the Russian history as Time of Troubles, sparked by the Russian dynastic crisis and overall internal chaos. The sides and their goals changed several times during this conflict: the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was not formally at war with Russia until 1609, and various Russian factions fought among themselves, allied with the Commonwealth and other countries or fighting against them. Sweden also participated in the conflict during the course of the Ingrian War (1610–1617), sometimes allying itself with Russia, and other times fighting against it.  The aims of the various factions changed frequently as well as the scale of the party's goals which ranged from minor border adjustment to imposing the Polish Kings or the impostors backed by Poland to the  Russian throne and even the creating a new state by forming a union between the Commonwealth and Russia. The war can be divided into four stages.
