     The Ukrainian famine (1932–1933), or Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомор) (literally in Ukrainian, "death by hunger"), was one of the largest national catastrophes in the modern history of the Ukrainian nation.

The term Holodomor is applied only to the famine that took place in the territories of the Ukrainian SSRHelen Fawkes, "Legacy of famine divides Ukraine", BBC News, November 24, 2006 during the wider famine that affected other regions of the USSR.  The term Holodomor is sometimes applied to the famine that occurred at the same time in other areas populated by ethnic Ukrainians outside of Soviet Ukraine. Modern historians state that the famine was caused by the sudden radical economic changes brought on by Stalinist policies that were implemented by the government of the Soviet Union.  It is sometimes argued that natural causes may have been the primary reason for the disaster. There also exists a minority group who deny the Holodomor outright. There is no international consensus among scholars :LINKNUM:438
