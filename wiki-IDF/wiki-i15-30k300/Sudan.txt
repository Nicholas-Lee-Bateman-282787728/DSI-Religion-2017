    Sudan (officially the Republic of The Sudan) (as-Sūdān)http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sudan&searchmode=none is the largest country in Africahttp://www.sudani.co.za/economy_agricul_sudan.htm and tenth largest country in the world by area. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Eritrea and Ethiopia to the east, Kenya and Uganda to the southeast, Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest. The country's name derives from the Arabic Bilad-al-sudan, literally "lands of the blacks."       Archaeological evidence has confirmed that the area in the north of Sudan was inhabited at least 60,000 years ago. A settled culture appeared in the area around 8000&nbsp;BC, living in fortified mud-brick villages, where they subsisted on hunting and fishing, as well as grain gathering and cattle herding. The area was known to the Egyptians as Kush and had strong cultural and religious ties to Egypt. In the 8th century&nbsp;BC, however, Kush came under the rule of an aggressive line of monarchs, ruling from the capital city, Napata, who gradually extended their influence into Egypt. About 750&nbsp;BC, a Kushite king called Kashta conquered Upper Egypt and became ruler of Thebes until approximately 740&nbsp;BC. His successor, Piankhy, subdued the delta, reunited Egypt under the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, and founded a line of kings who ruled Kush and Thebes for about a hundre :LINKNUM:504
