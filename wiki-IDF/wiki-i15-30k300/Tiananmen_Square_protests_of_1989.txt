  The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were a series of demonstrations led by labor activists, students, and intellectuals in the People's Republic of China (PRC). They began on April 15, 1989 and were brought to an end by a June 4, 1989 crackdown referred to as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or in China as the June Fourth Incident (六四事件). While the protests lacked a unified cause or leadership, participants generally opposed corruption in the Chinese Communist Party and voiced calls for democratic reform within the structure of the government. The demonstrations centered on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, but large-scale protests also occurred in cities throughout China, including Shanghai, which stayed peaceful throughout the protests. In Beijing, the resulting military crackdown on the protesters by the PRC government left many civilians dead or injured. The toll ranges from 200&ndash;300 (PRC government figures), to 400&ndash;800 (The New York Times), and to 2,000&ndash;3,000 (Chinese student associations and Chinese Red Cross). Following the violence, the government conducted widespread arrests to suppress protestors and their supporters, cracked down on other protests around China, banned the foreign press from the country, and strictly controlled coverage of the events in the PRC press. Members of the Party who had publicly sympathized with the protesters were purged, with several high-ranking members placed under house arrest, such as General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
