  }  Pluto (, from , ), also designated 134340 Pluto, is the second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System (after Eris) and the tenth-largest body observed directly orbiting the Sun. Originally classified as a planet, Pluto is now considered the largest memberPluto is the largest Kuiper belt object (KBO); According to Wikipedia convention, which treats the Scattered disc as distinct, Eris, although larger than Pluto, is not a KBO. of a distinct region called the Kuiper belt. Like other members of the belt, it is composed primarily of rock and ice and is relatively small: approximately a fifth the mass of the Earth's moon and a third its volume. It has an eccentric orbit that takes it from 30 to 49 AU (4.4â€“7.4 billion&nbsp;km) from the Sun, and is highly inclined with respect to the  planets. As a result, Pluto occasionally comes closer to the Sun than the planet Neptune does. Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, are often treated together as a binary system because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within either body.  The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, Charon is classified as a moon of Pluto.  Pluto has two known smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, discovered in 2005.  From its discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto was counted as the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, however, many objects similar to Pluto were discovered in the :LINKNUM:357
