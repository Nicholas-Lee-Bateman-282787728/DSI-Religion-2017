It is the only Canadian province with a predominantly French-speaking population, and the only one in which the sole official language at the provincial level is French. However, there is a significant English-speaking minority and English is widely spoken, especially in Montreal. Other elements of French tradition, such as the system of civil law, also remain strong in Quebec. Nationalism plays a big role in the politics of the province, with all three major provincial political parties seeking greater autonomy and recognition of the Quebec people as a nation.. Sovereigntist governments held referendums on independence in 1980 and 1995, and the Canadian House of Commons passed a symbolic motion recognizing the "Québécois as a nation within Canada". Quebec is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario, James Bay and Hudson Bay, to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay, to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick.
