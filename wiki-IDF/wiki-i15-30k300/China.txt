      China (; Wade-Giles (Mandarin): Chung¹kuo²) is a cultural region, an ancient civilization, and a national or multinational entity in East Asia. The civilization is one of the world's oldest, consisting of states and cultures dating back more than six millennia. China is one of the world's oldest continuous civilizations.  It has the world's longest continuously used written language system, and the source of such major inventions as what the British scholar and biochemist Joseph Needham called the Four Great Inventions of Ancient China: paper, the compass, gunpowder, and printing. The stalemate of the last Chinese Civil War has resulted in two states using the name China: the People's Republic of China (PRC), commonly known as China, which controls mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau; and the Republic of China (ROC), commonly known as Taiwan, which controls the island of Taiwan and its surrounding islands.  China is called Zhongguo (中國 or 中国) in Chinese. The character zhōng (中) means "middle" or "central," while guó (国 or 國) means "state". The term is commonly translated into English as "Middle Kingdom", but is also sometimes translated as "Central Kingdom". *Rossabi, Morris, ed.
