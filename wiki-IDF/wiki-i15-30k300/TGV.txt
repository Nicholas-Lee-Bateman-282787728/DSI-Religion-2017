       The TGV (train Ã  grande vitesse, French for "high-speed train") is France's high-speed rail service developed by GEC-Alsthom (now Alstom) and SNCF, the French national rail operator, and operated primarily by SNCF. Following the inaugural TGV service between Paris and Lyon in 1981, the TGV network, centred on Paris, has expanded to connect cities across France and in adjacent countries. It holds the record for the fastest wheeled train, having reached 574.8&nbsp;km/h (357&nbsp;mph) on 3 April, 2007,  and also holds the world's highest average speed for a regular passenger service. TGV is a registered trademark of SNCF. The success of the first line led to an expansion of the network, with new lines built in the south, west, north and east of the country. Eager to emulate the success of the French network, neighbouring countries such as Belgium, Italy, Spain and Germany built their own high-speed lines. TGVs link with Switzerland through the French network, with Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands through the Thalys network, and the Eurostar network links France and Belgium with the United Kingdom. Several lines are planned, including extensions within France and to surrounding countries. Towns such as Tours have become a part of a "TGV commuter belt". TGV trainsets travel at up to 320&nbsp;km/h (200&nbsp;mph) in commercial use. A specially modified trainset reached 574.8&nbsp;km/h (357 mph) on test runs.
