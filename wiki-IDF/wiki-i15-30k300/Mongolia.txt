  Mongolia () () is a landlocked country in East-Central Asia. It borders Russia to the north and China to the south. The capital and largest city is Ulan Bator. Mongolia's political system is a parliamentary republic. At 1,564,116&nbsp;square kilometres, Mongolia is the nineteenth largest, and the least densely populated independent country in the world with a population of around 2.9 million people. It is also the world's second-largest landlocked country after Kazakhstan. The country contains very little arable land, as much of its area is covered by arid and unproductive steppes, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south. Approximately thirty percent of the country's 2.9&nbsp;million people are nomadic or semi-nomadic. The predominant religion in Mongolia is Tibetan Buddhism, and the majority of the state's citizens are of the Mongol ethnicity, though Kazakhs, Tuvans, and other minorities also live in the country, especially in the west. About 38% of the population lives in Ulan Bator.  One of the greatest advances in human culture is the nomadic pastoralism , the adaptation by  nomadic people to survival on the world's  grassland by raising  livestock rather than crops which are unsuitable to the terrain.  Nomads currently surviving on the  Tibetan Plateau and in the  Himalayas are the remainders of nomadic practices once widespread in Asia and Africa.  The area of Mongolia was part of various steppe empires like those of the Hsiung-nu, Göktür :LINKNUM:423
