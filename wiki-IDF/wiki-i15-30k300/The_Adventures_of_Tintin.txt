 The Adventures of Tintin (, ) is a series of comic books created by Belgian artist Hergé, the pen name of Georges Remi (1907&ndash;1983). The series first appeared in French in a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper  on January 10, 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, The Adventures of Tintin presents a number of characters in distinctive settings. The series has continued as a favourite of readers and critics alike for over 70 years. The hero of the series is the eponymous character, Tintin, a young Belgian reporter and traveller. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but tone deaf Professor Calculus and other colourful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson. The success of the series saw the serialised strips collected into a series of albums (23 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for both film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Hergé's signature  style."Tintin and the enigma of academic obsession" The Daily Telegraph (London); July 1, 2006; Toby Clements; p. 006 :LINKNUM:442
