   Ammonia is a compound with the formula NH3. It is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor.  Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers.  Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, also is a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals.  Although in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous. Ammonia, as used commercially, is often called anhydrous ammonia. This term emphasizes the absence of water in the material.  Because NH3 boils at -33 °C, the liquid must be stored under high pressure or at low temperature.  Its heat of vaporization is, however, sufficiently great that NH3 can be readily handled in ordinary beakers in a fume hood.  "Household ammonia" or "ammonium hydroxide" is a solution of NH3 in water.  The strength of such solutions is measured in units of baume (density), with 26 degrees baume (about 30 weight percent ammonia at 15.5 °C) being the typical high concentration commercial product.Ammonium hydroxide physical properties Household ammonia ranges in concentration from 5 to 10 weight percent ammonia. (See Baumé scale) The ammonia molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape, as predicted by VSEPR theory.  The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a lone electron pair, and ammonia acts as a base, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar so that ammonia readily dissolves in water.  In  water :LINKNUM:410
