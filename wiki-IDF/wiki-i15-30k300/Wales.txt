 Wales (;Also spelled "Gymru", "Nghymru" or "Chymru" in certain contexts, as Welsh is a language with initial mutations— see Welsh morphology. pronounced ) is one of the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Wales is closely, but far from completely, integrated politically with England, although it was from around the 16th century until the mid-19th century (see Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542).  It is located in the south-west of the island of Great Britain and is bordered by England to the east, the Bristol Channel (Môr Hafren) to the south and the Irish Sea (Môr Iwerddon) to the west and north, and also by the estuary of the River Dee (Afon Dyfrdwy) in the north-east. It shares political and legal structures to varying degrees with Scotland, England and Northern Ireland. Welsh cultural identity is represented by elements such as the Welsh language, ancient Welsh festivals and traditions, monastic asceticism, a highly evolved secular legal system (Cyfraith Hywel), and a distinctive literary tradition and culture which emerged after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century. Of the principal polities within Wales, only Gwynedd retained independence until the late 13th century, when it was eventually conquered by medieval England. However, formal annexation and abolition of Welsh law did not take place until the 16th century.
