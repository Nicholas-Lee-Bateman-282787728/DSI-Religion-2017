  The recorded military history of Puerto Rico encompasses the period from the 16th century, when Spanish conquistadores battled native Tainos, to the present employment of Puerto Ricans in the United States Armed Forces in the military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Puerto Rico was part of the Spanish Empire for four centuries, when the Puerto Ricans defended themselves against invasions from the British, French, and Dutch.  During the mid-19th century, the quest for Latin American independence from Spain spread to Puerto Rico, culminating in the failed revolution known as El Grito de Lares.  The island was invaded by the United States during the Spanish-American War; the war ended when Spain officially ceded the island under the 1898 Treaty of Paris.  Puerto Rico became a United States territory and a military regiment known as the Porto Rico Regiment was established on the island. As citizens of the United States, Puerto Ricans have participated in every major United States military engagement from World War I, with Puerto Rico's 65th Infantry Regiment distinguishing themselves in combat during the Korean War. The following is brief history of the  military events in which Puerto Ricans have participated. Christopher Columbus discovered the island of Puerto Rico on November 19, 1493 during his second voyage to the New World.  The island was inhabited by the Arawak group of indigenous peoples known as Tainos, who called the island "Borik√©n" or "Borinquen". Columbus name :LINKNUM:516
