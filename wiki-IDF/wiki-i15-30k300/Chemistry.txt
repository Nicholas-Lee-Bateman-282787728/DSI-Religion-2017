    Chemistry (from Egyptian kÄ“me (chem), meaning "earth"See: Chemistry (etymology) for possible origins of this word.) is the science concerned with  the composition, structure, and properties of matter, as well as the changes it undergoes during chemical reactions.Chemistry. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007. Historically, modern chemistry evolved out of alchemy following the chemical revolution (1773). Chemistry is a physical science related to studies of various atoms, molecules, crystals and other  aggregates of matter whether in isolation or combination, which incorporates the concepts of energy and entropy in relation to the spontaneity of chemical processes. Disciplines within chemistry are traditionally grouped by the type of matter being studied or the kind of study. These include inorganic chemistry, the study of inorganic matter; organic chemistry, the study of organic matter; biochemistry, the study of substances found in biological organisms; physical chemistry, the energy related studies of chemical systems at macro, molecular and submolecular scales; analytical chemistry, the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. neurochemistry the chemical study of the nervous system (see subdisciplines).
