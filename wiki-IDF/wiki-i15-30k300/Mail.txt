 Mail is a method for transmitting information and tangible objects, wherein written documents, typically enclosed in envelopes, and also small packages, are delivered to destinations around the world. Anything sent through the postal system is called mail or post.In Australia, Canada and the U.S., mail is commonly used both for the postal system and for letters and parcels; in New Zealand, post is more common for the postal system and mail for the material delivered; in the UK, post prevails in both senses.  However, the British, American, Australian, and Canadian national postal services are called, respectively, Royal Mail, United States Postal Service, Australia Post, and Canada Post; in addition, such fixed phrases as post office or junk mail are found throughout the English-speaking world. In principle, a postal service can be private or public. Governments often place restrictions on private postal delivery systems. Since the mid 19th century national postal systems have generally been established as government monopolies with a fee on the article prepaid.  Proof of payment is often in the form of adhesive postage stamps, but postage meters are also used for bulk mailing. Postal systems often have functions other than sending letters. In some countries, the postal system also has some authority over telephone and telegraph systems.  In others, postal systems allow for savings accounts and handling applications for passports.
