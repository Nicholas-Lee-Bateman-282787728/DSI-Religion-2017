    A tornado is a violently rotating column of air which is in contact with both a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, a cumulus cloud base and the surface of the earth. Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris. Most tornadoes have wind speeds of 110&nbsp;mph(177&nbsp;km/h) or less, are approximately 250&nbsp;feet (75&nbsp;m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating.  Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480&nbsp;km/h), stretch more than a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100&nbsp;km).   Although tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica, most occur in the United States.  They also commonly occur in southern Canada, south-central and eastern Asia, east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, Italy, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand.    The word "tornado" is an altered form of the Spanish word tronada, which means "thunderstorm". This in turn was taken from the Latin tonare, meaning "to thunder".  It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish tronada and tornar ("to turn"); however, this may be a folk etymology.  Tornadoes are also commonly referred to as twisters.   Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (a few hun :LINKNUM:364
