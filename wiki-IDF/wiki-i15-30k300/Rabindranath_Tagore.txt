He became Asia's first Nobel laureate when he won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature. A Pirali Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta, Tagore first wrote poems at the age of eight. At the age of sixteen, he published his first substantial poetry under the pseudonym Bhanushingho ("Sun Lion") and wrote his first short stories and dramas in 1877.

Tagore strongly protested against the British Raj and gave his support to the Indian Independence Movement and Mahatma Gandhi.

Tagore wrote novels, short stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays on political and personal topics.
