   The Great Lakes are a chain of freshwater lakes located in eastern North America, on the Canada-United States border. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or Michigan-Huron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth. They are sometimes referred to as inland seas or Canada and the United States' fourth coast. The Great Lakes region contains not only the five main lakes themselves, but also numerous minor lakes and rivers, as well as approximately 35,000 islands. Lakes Michigan and Huron are hydrologically a single lake, sometimes called Lake Michigan-Huron; they have the same surface elevation of  , and are not connected by a river but by the  deep Straits of Mackinac. There are many other minor lakes within the Great Lakes basin; however, they are not large enough to be considered as one of the Great Lakes proper. They include: Lake St. Clair, Lake Nipigon, Wanapitei Lake,  Lake Nipissing, Lake Simcoe, Lake Winnebago, Oneida Lake, and the Finger Lakes of Upstate New York. Dispersed throughout the Great Lakes are approximately 35,000 islands. The largest among them is Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, the largest island in any inland body of water and home to the world's largest lake within a lake, Lake Manitou. The second-largest island is Isle Royale in Lake Superior. Both of these islands are large enough to contain multiple lakes themselves.
