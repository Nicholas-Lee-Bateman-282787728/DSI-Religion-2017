    The Palestinian National Authority (PNA or PA;  As-Sulta Al-Wataniyya Al-FilastÄ«niyya) is an interim administrative organization, established to govern parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian National Authority was formed in 1994, pursuant to the Oslo Accords between the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the government of Israel, as a 5-year transitional body during which final status negotiations between the two parties were to take place. According to the Accords, the Palestinian Authority was designated to have control over both security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban areas (referred to as "Area A"), and only civilian control over Palestinian rural areas ("Area B"). The remainder of the territories, including Israeli settlements, the Jordan Valley region, and bypass roads between Palestinian communities, were to remain under exclusive Israeli control ("Area C"). East Jerusalem was excluded from the Accords. The Palestinian Authority is a subsidiary agency of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Also, it is the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, not the Palestinian National Authority, which enjoys international recognition as the organization representing the Palestinian people. The Palestinian diaspora, living outside the West Bank and Gaza, which constitutes the majority of the Palestinian people, do not vote in elections for Palestinian National Authority offices.
