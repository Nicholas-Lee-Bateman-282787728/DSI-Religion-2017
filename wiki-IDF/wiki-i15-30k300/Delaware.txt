   Delaware () is a state located on the Atlantic Coast in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.While the U.S. Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the South Atlantic States, most consider it to be a part of the Mid-Atlantic States and/or Northeastern United States.  Examples include other U.S. government agencies (such as the Library of Congress, Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, National Park Service, and Department of Energy), and public service organizations (such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Amtrak, and the Princeton Review).  Google's categorization scheme includes it in both the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions.  The state is named after Delaware Bay and River, which were named for Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577â€“1618). Population estimates by the Census Bureau for 2005 place the population of Delaware at 843,524. Despite ranking 45th in population, it is the seventh most densely populated state, with a population density of 320 more people per square mile than the national average, ranking ahead of states such as Florida, California, and Texas.  The state's motto, "Liberty and Independence" is inscribed on the coat of arms, which is incorporated into both the state seal and the state flag.  The state's official nickname, "The First State" commemorates the fact that on December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first of the 13 original states to ratify the United States Constitution.http://www.state.de.us/gic/delfacts/gov.shtmlEven  :LINKNUM:490
