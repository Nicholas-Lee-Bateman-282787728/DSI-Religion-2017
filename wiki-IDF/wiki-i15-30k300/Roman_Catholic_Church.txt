    The Roman Catholic Church, often referred to as the Catholic Church, is the world's largest Christian church, representing over half of all Christians and one sixth of the world's population. It is made up of one Western or Latin and 22 Eastern Catholic autonomous particular churches, and divided into 2,782 jurisdictional areas around the world. These churches look to the Bishop of Rome (commonly called the pope), either alone or together with the College of Bishops, as their highest visible authority in matters of faith, morals, and church governance. The reigning pope is Pope Benedict XVI. The church community consists of the ordained ministries of bishops, priests, and deacons; and the laity, nuns, friars, and monks of whom only monks or friars who serve as priests are ordained. The primary mission of the Roman Catholic Church is to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and administer the sacraments.  In aid of this mission, the church operates social programs, institutions, and ministries throughout the world. These include schools, universities, hospitals, and shelters, as well as Catholic Relief Services and Catholic Charities that help the poor, families, the elderly, the sick, among others.Barry, One Faith, One Lord (2001), pp. 98&ndash;9Schaff-Herzog, Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge (1911), p. 80 As with the Eastern Orthodox and mainstream Protestants, the Roman Catholic faith is summarized in the Nicene Creed.
