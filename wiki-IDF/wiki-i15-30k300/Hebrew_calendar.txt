  The Hebrew calendar () or Jewish calendar is a lunisolar calendar used by Jews for predominantly religious purposes.  It is used to reckon the Jewish New Year and dates for Jewish holidays, and also to determine appropriate public reading of Torah portions, Yahrzeits (dates to commemorate the death of a relative), and daily Psalm reading, among many ceremonial uses.  Originally the Hebrew calendar was used by Jews for all quotidian purposes, but by the era of the Roman occupation (1st Century BCE), Jews were compelled to follow the imperial civil calendar for all civic matters such as the payment of taxes and dealings with government officials. The Hebrew calendar's epoch (reference date), 1 Tishrei 1 anno mundi, is equivalent to Monday, October 7, 3761 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar, the equivalent tabular date (same daylight period) and is about one year before the traditional Jewish date of Creation on 25 Elul AM 1, based upon the Seder Olam Rabbah of Rabbi Yossi ben Halafta, a second century CE sage.A minority opinion places Creation on 25 Adar AM 1, six months earlier, or six months after the modern epoch. Thus, adding 3760 or 3761Between September-October and December, ie, after Rosh Hashana, add 3761 to any Julian/Gregorian year number after 1 CE will yield the Hebrew year.  For earlier years there may be a discrepancy (see: "Missing Years" in the Hebrew Calendar). Two major forms of the calendar have been used.
