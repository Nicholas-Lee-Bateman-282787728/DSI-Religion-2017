    In Greek and Roman mythology, Apollo (in Greek, Ἀπόλλων &mdash; Apóllōn or Ἀπέλλων &mdash; Apellōn), is one of the most important and many-sided of the Olympian deities.  The ideal of the kouros (a beardless youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun; truth and prophecy; archery; medicine and healing; music, poetry, and the arts; and more.  Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu. In Roman mythology he is known as Apollo. As the patron of Delphi (Pythian Apollo), Apollo was an oracular god — the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. Medicine and healing were associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius.  Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague as well as one who had the ability to cure.  Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.  As the leader of the Muses (Apollon Musagetes) and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry.  Hermes created the lyre for him, and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo. Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans. In Hellenistic times, especially during the third century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, god of the sun, and his sister Artemis :LINKNUM:479
