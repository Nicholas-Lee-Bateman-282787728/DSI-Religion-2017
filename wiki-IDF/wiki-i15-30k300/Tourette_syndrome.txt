   Tourette syndrome (also called Tourette's syndrome, Tourette's disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, GTS or, more commonly, simply Tourette's or TS) is an inherited neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of multiple physical (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic; these tics characteristically wax and wane. Tourette's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders, which includes transient and chronic tics. Tourette's was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with the exclamation of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks (coprolalia).  However, this symptom is present in only a small minority of people with Tourette's.Schapiro NA. "Dude, you don't have Tourette's:" Tourette's syndrome, beyond the tics.

Tourette's is no longer considered a rare condition, but it may not always be correctly identified because most cases are classified as mild.  Between 1 and 11 children per 1,000 have Tourette's; as many as 10 per 1,000 people may have tic disorders,Scahill L, Williams S, Schwab-Stone M, Applegate J, Leckman JF.
