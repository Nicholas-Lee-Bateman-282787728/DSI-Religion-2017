   The State of Colorado is a state located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States of America. Colorado may also be considered to be a part of the Western and Southwestern regions of the United States.  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the state population was 4,861,515 in 2007, a 13.03% increase since the U.S. Census 2000.  Denver is the capital as well as the most populous city of Colorado. Citizens of Colorado are known as Coloradans. The State of Colorado is defined as the geoellipsoidal rectangle that stretches from 37°N to 41°N latitude and from 102°03'W to 109°03'W longitude (25°W to 32°W from the Washington Meridian).  Colorado is one of only three U.S. states (with Wyoming and Utah) that have only lines of latitude and longitude for boundaries.  The summit of Mount Elbert at  elevation in Lake County is the state's highest point and the highest point in the entire Rocky Mountains.   Colorado has more than 500 mountain peaks that exceed  elevation. Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies entirely above  elevation.  The point where the Arikaree River flows out of Yuma County, Colorado, and into Cheyenne County, Kansas, is the lowest point in the State of Colorado at  elevation.  This crossing point holds the distinction of being the highest low point of any U.S. state.  East of the Southern Rocky Mountains are the Colorado Eastern Plains of the High Plains, the section of the Great Plains within Colorado at elevations ranging from 3314 to 656 :LINKNUM:629
