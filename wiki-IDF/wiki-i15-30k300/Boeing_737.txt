 The Boeing 737 is an American short to medium range, single aisle, narrow body jet airliner. Developed from Boeing's 727 and 707, the 737 is now available in a number of versions, from the -200 to the most recent addition, the -900ER. First envisioned in 1964, the 737 entered service in 1968, and 25 years after the announcement of its first sale it has become the most ordered and produced commercial passenger jet in the world. Continuously manufactured by Boeing since 1967 with over 7,000 ordered and over 5,000 delivered (as of 2007), there are over 1,250 of the type airborne at any given time. On average, a 737 departs or lands somewhere every five seconds. Boeing had been studying short-haul jet aircraft designs and wanted to produce another aircraft to supplement the 727 on short and thin routes.  Preliminary design work began on 11 May 1964,Endres, 2001, p.122. and Boeing's intense market research yielded plans for a 50 to 60 passenger plane for routes 50 to 1,000&nbsp;mi (80 to 1,609&nbsp;km) long.Sharpe and Shaw, 2001, pg 12. Lufthansa became the launch customer on 19 February 1965,Sharpe and Shaw, 2001, pg 13. with an order of 21 aircraft, worth $67&nbsp;million (1965, $190.28&nbsp;million in 2008), after the airline reportedly received assurances from Boeing that the 737 project would not be cancelled. Consultation with Lufthansa over the previous winter resulted in an increase in capacity to 100 seats. On 5 April 1965, Boeing announced an order by United Airlines fo :LINKNUM:372
