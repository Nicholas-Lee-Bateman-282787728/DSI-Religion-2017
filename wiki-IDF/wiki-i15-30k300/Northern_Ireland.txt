   Northern Ireland (, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, lying in the northeast of the island of Ireland, covering 5,459&nbsp;square miles (14,139&nbsp;kmÂ²), about a sixth of the island's total area.The Northern Ireland Act 1998 describes Northern Ireland as "part of the United Kingdom". The term "constituent country" is sometimes applied to Northern Ireland by Unionists and British sources.&nbsp;[ ] [ ].The term is rejected by most Irish Nationalists. At the time of the UK Census in April 2001, its population was 1,685,000, between a quarter and a third of the island's total population. Northern Ireland consists of six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster. In the UK, it is generally known as one of the four Home Nations that form the Kingdom. Some of these terms have controversial implications in relation to political ideologies concerning the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. As an administrative division of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland was defined by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and has had its own form of devolved government in a similar manner to Scotland and Wales. The Northern Ireland Assembly, established in 1998, has been suspended multiple times but was restored on 8 May, 2007.The Assembly operates on consociational democracy principles requiring cross community support. Due to a lack of cross party support, the Assembly was prorogued by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Northe :LINKNUM:490
