Sugar as a basic food carbohydrate primarily comes from sugar cane and from sugar beet, but also appears in fruit, honey, sorghum, sugar maple (in maple syrup), and in many other sources. It forms the main ingredient in much candy. Excessive consumption of sugar has been associated with increased incidences of type-2 diabetes, obesity and tooth-decay. In non-scientific use, the term sugar  refers to sucrose (also called "table sugar" or "saccharose") â€” a white crystalline solid disaccharide. In this informal sense, the word "sugar" principally refers to crystalline sugars. Humans most commonly use sucrose as their sugar of choice for altering the flavor and properties (such as mouthfeel, preservation, and texture) of beverages and food. Commercially-produced table-sugar comes either from sugar cane or from sugar beet. Manufacturing and preparing food may involve other sugars, including palm sugar and fructose, generally obtained from corn (maize) or from fruit. Sugar may dissolve in water to form a syrup. A great many foods exist which principally contain dissolved sugar. Generically known as "syrups", they may also have other more specific names such as "honey" or "molasses". Scientifically, sugar refers to any monosaccharide or disaccharide. Monosaccharides (also called "simple su :LINKNUM:400
