   This timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites charts the progress of the discovery of new bodies over history. Historically the naming of natural satellites did not always match the times of their discovery. In the following tables, planetary satellites are indicated in bold type (e.g. Moon) while planets, major or minor, which directly circle the Sun are in italic type (e.g. Earth). The tables are sorted by publication/announcement date. Dates are annotated with the following symbols: *Note: Marked moons had complicated discoveries. Several moons took several years to be confirmed, and in several cases were actually lost and rediscovered. Others were found in Voyager photographs years after they were taken. The planets and their natural satellites are marked in the following colors:            |- |colspan="1" bgcolor=#FFE8E8| Jupiter  |bgcolor=black|  ||bgcolor=#FFE8E8| 5th Planet |- |colspan="1" bgcolor=#FFFFCC| Saturn  |bgcolor=black|  ||bgcolor=#FFFFCC| 6th Planet |- |colspan="1" bgcolor=#CCCC99 | Moon  | bgcolor=black|   |bgcolor=#CCCC99 | Earth I |bgcolor=#CCCC99 | In the Copernican system, the Moon was considered to be no longer a planet but a natural satellite of the Earth, and was the only body in that system whose revolution was not centered on the Sun. |} Prehistory Name Image Planet/Number Designation References/Notes Sun Star In the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was believed to be at the center of the cosmos.
