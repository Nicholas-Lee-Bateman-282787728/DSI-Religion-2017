 Cryptography (or cryptology; derived from Greek κρύπτω kryptó "hidden" and the verb γράφω  gráfo  "to write" or λέγειν legein "to speak")Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon. Oxford University Press. (1984) is the practice   and study of hiding information. In modern times, cryptography is considered to be a branch of both mathematics and computer science, and is affiliated closely with information theory, computer security, and engineering. Cryptography is used in applications present in technologically advanced societies; examples include the security of ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce, which all depend on cryptography. Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, the process of converting ordinary information (plaintext) into unintelligible gibberish (ie, ciphertext).  Decryption is the reverse, moving from unintelligible ciphertext to plaintext.  A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms which creates the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and, in each instance, by a key. This is a secret parameter (ideally, known only to the communicants) for a specific message exchange context. Keys are important, as ciphers without variable keys are trivially breakable and therefore less than useful for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption, without additional procedures such as authentication or :LINKNUM:359
