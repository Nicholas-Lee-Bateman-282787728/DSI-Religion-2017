   The city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is home to a vibrant and well-documented musical heritage, stretching back to colonial times.  Innovations in classical music, opera, R&B, jazz and soul have earned the music of Philadelphia national and international renown.  Philadelphia's musical institutions have long played an important role in the music of Pennsylvania, as well as a nationwide impact, especially in the early development of hip hop music.  Philadelphia's diverse population has also given it a reputation for styles ranging from dancehall to Irish traditional music, as well as a thriving classical and folk music scene. Philadelphia's musical heritage has been described by music author Richie Unterberger, as "not nearly as (influential) in American popular music as its size might indicate", which Unterberger attributes to a "[musical] shadow thrown by New York", which is not far north of Philadelphia.  Nevertheless, Unterberger notes that Philadelphia has "played an important part in the history of rock and roll by being home to one of the most dependable audiences on the planet, rather than as an incubator of major performers".  Unterberger also noted Philadelphia's role as a home to major radio personalities and DJs, as well as a major popular music field, Philadelphia soul Unterberger, pg. 67Unterberger compares Philadelphia to Cleveland, which is identical in all his descriptors save being home to a major field of popular music; the reference to New York's shado :LINKNUM:350
