    Maryland () is a state located in the Mid Atlantic region of the United States.While the U.S. Census Bureau designates Maryland as one of the South Atlantic States, many consider it to be a part of the Mid-Atlantic States and/or Northeastern United States. Examples include other U.S. government agencies (such as the Library of Congress, Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, National Park Service, and Department of Energy), and public service organizations (such as  Amtrak and the Princeton Review).  Google's categorization scheme includes it in both the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions.  It is comparable in size to the European country of Belgium.  According to the most recent information provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, as of August 2007, Maryland is now the wealthiest state in the United States, with a median household income of US$65,144, ahead of New Jersey which had previously held that title. It was the seventh state to ratify the United States Constitution and bears two nicknames, the Old Line State and the Free State.  Its history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and Southern regions of the United States. As a general rule, the rural areas of Maryland, such as Western, Southern, and Maryland's Eastern Shore, are more Southern in culture, while densely-populated Central Maryland — areas in the Baltimore and the Washington Beltway Regions — exhibit more Northern characteristics.
