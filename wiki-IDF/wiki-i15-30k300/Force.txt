    In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate. It may be experienced as a twist, a push, or a pull. The acceleration of a body is proportional to the vector sum of all forces acting on it (known as the net force or resultant force). In an extended body, force may also cause rotation, deformation, or a change in pressure. Rotational effects are determined by the torques, while deformation and pressure are determined by the stresses that the forces create.e.g. ; .University Physics, Sears, Young & Zemanksy, pp18&ndash;38 Net force is mathematically equal to the time rate of change of the momentum of the body on which it acts. See for example pages 9-1 and 9-2 of Feynman, Leighton and Sands (1963). Since momentum is a vector quantity (i.e., it has both a magnitude and direction), force also is a vector quantity. The concept of force has been used in statics and dynamics since ancient times. Ancient contributions to statics culminated in the work of Archimedes in the 3rd century BC, which still forms part of modern physics. In contrast, Aristotle's dynamics incorporated intuitive misunderstandings of the role of force which were eventually corrected in the 17th century, culminating in the work of Isaac Newton. Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that particles influence each other through fundamental interactions, and therefore the standard model of particle physics demands that everything experienced fundamentally as a "force" is actu :LINKNUM:423
