 Sierra Leone, officially the Republic of Sierra Leone, is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Guinea in the north and east, Liberia in the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean in the southwest and west. Sierra Leone covers a total area of 71,740 sq km (27,699 sq mi) and has a tropical climate, with a diverse environment ranging from savannah to rainforests. Freetown is the capital, seat of government, and largest city. Sierra Leone was first inhabited by the Sherbro, Temne and Limba peoples, and later the Mende,Kup (1961), p. 116    who knew the country as Romarong.    In 1462, it was visited by the Portuguese explorer Pedro da Cintra, who gave it its current designation, meaning 'Lion Mountains'.Room (1995), p. 346-7    Sierra Leone became an important centre of the transatlantic slave trade, until 1787 when Freetown was founded by the Sierra Leone Company as a home for formerly enslaved African Americans and West Indians.    In 1808, Freetown became a British Crown Colony, and in 1896, the interior of the country became a British Protectorate;    in 1961, the two combined and gained independence.  Political instability over the following decades eventually led to the Sierra Leone Civil War,Sillinger (2003), p. 104    which began in 1991 and was resolved with the assistance of the United Nations in 2002. Since then, almost 72,500 former combatants have disarmedKeen (2005), p. 268    and the country has reestablished a functioning democracy.    The Special Court for Sie :LINKNUM:641
