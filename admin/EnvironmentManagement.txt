#install python 2.7

########THIS ONE COMMAND MADE IT WORK FOR JUPYTER#########
conda create -n py27 python=2.7 ipykernel

# see which environments you have 
conda info --envs

#switch to different environment
source activate py27 #py27 is the name of the new environment


#### TO INSTALL NEW PACKAGES
#switch to THE RIGHT environment
source activate py27
# then install with conda
conda install [some package]
# this works for most, but NOT for igraph (see notes below)


###AFTER MAKING CHANGES (installing libraries, etc.)
#export
conda env export > py27env.yml

#####ONLY IF I NEED TO MOVE TO ANOTHER COMPUTER, SERVER, ETC.
#reload
conda env create -f py27env.yml

######### INSTALLING IGRAPH
#this page: http://igraph.org/python/
#you should just be able to do 
pip install python-igraph #conda install... seems to not find it

#however, you often run into some errors about the C compiler, so you have to
## install homebrew: http://brew.sh
#then run
brew install homebrew/science/igraph
brew install pkg-config
# THEN...
pip install python-igraph

#####OR######
## so you have to INSTALL XCODE from the app store
###this didn't work for me, but apparently it should


##########THIS IS THE VIRTUALENV VERSION THAT NEVER WORKED FOR ME#########
#instal virtualenv
pip install virtualenv

#install virtualenvwrapper with these instructions:
#https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

pip install --user virtualenvwrapper

# tweak this for mac: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15101559/terminal-where-is-the-shell-start-up-file
cat >> ~/.bash_profile
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Documents
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
# press control+D
# ^D

# reload your bash
source ~/.bash_profile


mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 p2env




#when I didn't include --user in the install command above, I got all sorts of probems...
