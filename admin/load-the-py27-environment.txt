# the py27env.yml file should have everything you need
# to tell your computer what to install to setup the environment
# needed for our project. HOWEVER, iGraph is a pain in the ass so you 
# might need to do the extra steps below.

# open a terminal
# navigate into the directory with the py27env.yml file (probably './DSI-Religion-2017/admin')
# then call:
conda env create -f py27env.yml

# if you get an error from iGraph...
######### INSTALLING IGRAPH
# it should just load from the .yml file like everything else
#however, you often run into some errors about the C compiler, so you have to:

## install homebrew: http://brew.sh
#then run
brew install homebrew/science/igraph
brew install pkg-config
# THEN...
pip install python-igraph

# these instructions come from this page: http://igraph.org/python/
# so check that if you have any problems.

########## once everything is installed
# see which environments you have (you should see py27 as an option)
conda info --envs

#to switch into the new environment (to run any of our code)
source activate py27 
# or just open a jupyter notebook and change the kernel to py27
