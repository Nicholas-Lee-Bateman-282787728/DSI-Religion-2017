WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH newDocsModel.py

## all the (new) files that run in the first part need to say 'test'

## it needs to get the signals and then, instead of saving them...

## it needs to bring the big files for training, rename all the 'test' to 'train'
## then append the new testing signals to that DF
## then run the model
