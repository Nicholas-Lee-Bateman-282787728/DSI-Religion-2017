WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH newDocsModel.py

set it up to take input parameters

set the modeling part to take paramPath to tell it where to get the training signals

####
then figure out why the signal generator spits out NaN for so many rows!!!!

also, in the mean time, make it so that you can set the number of docs per bin 
	it'll be in the getNewDocs where it generates random test-ID 
	(generate only a certain number of IDs and dish them out)
