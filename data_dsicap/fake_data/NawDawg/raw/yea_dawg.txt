I said, "yea, dawg."

Riverside South is an urban development project in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. It was originated by six civic associations – Municipal Art Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, New Yorkers for Parks, Regional Plan Association, Riverside Park Fund, and Westpride – in partnership with Donald Trump. The largely residential complex, located on the site of a former New York Central Railroad yard includes Trump Place and Riverside Center. The $3 billion project is on 57-acre (23 ha) of land along the Hudson River between 59th Street and 72nd Street.

Development of the rail yard site generated considerable community opposition. Trump's 1970s-era proposal was opposed and failed to gain traction. In 1982, Lincoln West, a much smaller project, was approved with community support, but the developers failed to obtain financing. Planning for the current project began in the late 1980s. The project was originally designed to include 16 apartment buildings with a maximum of 5,700 residential units, 1,800,000 square feet (170,000 m2) of studio space, 300,000 square feet (30,000 m2) of office space, ancillary retail space, and a 25-acre (10 ha) waterfront park.

Trump sold Riverside South to investors from Hong Kong and China, who, began construction in 1997. In 2005, the investors sold the remaining unfinished portions to the Carlyle Group and the Extell Development Company.

The dog is good. The city is bad.
