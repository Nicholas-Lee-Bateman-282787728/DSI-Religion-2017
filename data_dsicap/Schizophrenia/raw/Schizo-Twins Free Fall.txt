Free Fall, About 1990

It's not until Carolyn walks into Pam's triple-decker in the South End of Hartford that she truly realizes how poorly her twin is doing. The place is overflowing with garbage, dirty laundry, plates filled with moldy food, old cat litter.

After Pam dropped out of medical school, she has been in and out of hospitals. Her life has been in a kind of free fall. Carolyn has been in phone contact with Pam but hasn't seen her much. No one in the family really understands what's happened to her.

Marian has felt caught in the middle. For years, she felt Howard acted as if Pam's illness was voluntary. Marian knows it

irritates him if she sees Pam. She feels she is being forced to choose between her husband and her daughter. She also is working full time now as a high school teacher. With these impediments, Marian sees Pam, but perhaps not as often as she might.

Neither Phil nor Martha has seen her much either. For them, it's partly the natural pulling away from family and leaving home for college and career. Phil hadn't been that close to Pam growing up and with her illness, he says now, "She was difficult to be with."

For Martha, it is about the heartbreak and confusion of seeing her sister so ill. Pam would tell her the police were monitoring her mind, and ask for Martha's help. "I didn't know anything to do," Martha says.

Now a unit chief at the Yale Psychiatric Institute, Carolyn drives up from New Haven and finds Pam hearing voices, cursing at them, rambling on about the "radiation" and the "five people" who are after her.

Carolyn puts her in her car and drives her to Cambridge, Mass., to see one of Harvard's most esteemed professors. After a 10-minute exam, the professor's words are cold and detached.

"Your sister is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic. There's not much else to do," he says.

Carolyn is shocked at his callousness.
