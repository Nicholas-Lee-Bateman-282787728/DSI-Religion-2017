                                   THE BULLDOZER
[if !supportEmptyParas]   [endif]
Outside across the street there was a bulldozer doing demolition work. A new Sears was supposed to go up, and the dozer was tearing part of the old one down. This seemed kind of sad to me, and I wondered if it was a message meant for me.
Suddenly I noticed the pay phone and remembered that I still needed to call Chris to tell him that I was ready to move in. Chris answered the phone, and said that he would be there waiting for me for the rest of the evening, and that whenever I got there would be fine. I hung up the phone and sat on the curb of the laundry-mat porch and watched the huge bull-dozer do it’s destruction. The dozer was tearing down something old, so that something new and better could be built. This was the message; I was leaving Matt’s so something better could happen for me. Something closer to Amelia, something better. I finished my cigarette, went inside and folded up my clothes, then went back to Matt’s to pack up my few belongings.
