A fatal meeting
While the home travel I became acquainted with a woman. Already after the first view contacts a large warmth flowed through my body and me was very unsteady in the heart area. I could not give her up no more, I thought, my heart otherwise would shatter. I was allowed to visit her and fell in love terribly. After two further visits with her and her two girls I was obviously too much for her. A letter came, she wrote: "Farewell!". I was despaired, could only cry in the first moment. I could not so simply say "Farewell!". It was impossible. The following days I was like paralysed. I could think of nothing different one than of her and this heart heat pain at our meeting. I must somehow be meant for her, I thought.
Phases, where I was well, changed off with days, where I was again completely internally paralysed and could only brood. I wrote letters, she should help me, I couldn't manage it alone. My thoughts circled only around my feeling to her. I interpreted my aches in the heart area as love pains. In films and radiosongs I found allusions to my situation and it tormented me. My relationship with nature during walks grew ever more emotional. I got still another letter, I should understand, it would be better so. But I was mentally at the end. I did not understand it any longer. After days of total mental paralysis I could not do no more. I went to her. She said, she had already a friend and I would have to go through.
Strange to say I felt as released. The children had still someone except the mother. I was relieved, but tiredly and deeply affected.
