Tired and Discouraged

It's not often, but on this October day Carolyn is downcast. Though rationally she knows that Pam doesn't decide to have a setback, part of her feels as if she does.

This is how it always seems to go, Carolyn says. Pam starts to get better. Carolyn starts to relax. "Oh, good, I can have a regular relationship. I can go back to my fantasy. Everything is going to be OK and then I hear from her or someone else: No, something else has happened.

"Part of me wants to get angry and tell her to think about me for once in her life," says Carolyn. Often, Carolyn has used this rationale when talking to Pam about suicide. "You can't kill yourself," she'll say. "Because if you kill yourself, you're killing me."

It is an argument Pam has listened to in the past, but now she is obsessed with a presence - a visual hallucination - that is so strong that she can't be released from the hospital until it is extinguished. When she looks at the biohazardous material stickers on waste containers, she sees the face of a frightening man with a mustache. She calls him the "Bio-Haz-Mat Man" and says she can't ignore his command to hurt herself.

"I keep thinking I should be able to reason her out of it," Carolyn says, knowing as she says it that it isn't possible.

Where the man has come from, no one is sure. Perhaps he is the result of her switch to another anti-psychotic that doesn't seem quite as effective.

Pam has voluntarily agreed to try electroshock therapy, to try to zap "Mr. Bio-Haz-Mat" out of her thoughts. Carolyn is concerned about this, but says, "At least it won't put on weight."
