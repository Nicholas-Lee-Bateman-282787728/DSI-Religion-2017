Introduction
First you have only certain physical symptoms, then you have suddenly new realizations about the world and your life situation. From one minute to the other you are the centre of a secret conspiracy of the world powers. You are watched, monitored by special agents of both sides and led to an uncertain aim. Naturally you are on the good side and have a mission. But which? Satellites are set onto you and a brain scanning machine. The opposing side wants to make you crazy. All television programs are made specially for you. You want to prove courage and bravery. You eats nothing more and makes stamina standing. After a narcosis, you believe the universe in your head would have inverted itself and the further existence of the universe would depend on an instability in your head. You believe therefore not to be allowed to think any longer clearly. The scientists of the earth monitor therefore your head! You are ready to let you dematerialize. Finally is the nightmare past. This is the strange, but true history of a severe psychotic episode, as I experienced it.
