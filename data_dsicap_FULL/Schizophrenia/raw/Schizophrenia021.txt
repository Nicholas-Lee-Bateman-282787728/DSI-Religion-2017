MARY
[if !supportEmptyParas]   [endif]
There was an old black woman that had been in a solitary locked cell the whole time I had spent at the ward, and now she was being let out on terms that she would behave. I had been curious several times and sneaked a look when I could to watch her, because I wanted to see if I could figure out what celebrity she might be. She screamed constantly inside this cell, and I was always immediately told to get away from her cell window when I was caught peeking.
Once they let her out, she must have been heavily medicated because for a long time she just sat and dreamed at the walls, never saying anything. After a day or so, she never screamed anymore, but would babble and laugh constantly. I soon decided that she must be the only real crazy patient in the ward. Those who controlled my cyber—world were seeing how I would relate to Mary, the laughing black woman. She walked with a shimmy that reminded me of a child, scooting her feet on the floor like she was enjoying the sound her feet made.
One day I was passing her in the hall and she heard me coming beside here and asked me to please help her to the lobby. I ignored her, and kept walking. A nurse ran to her and helped her to the lobby. I asked her why she was babying her, and the nurse looked at me sternly. “ Because she’s blind, that’s why?” I jumped out of my chair and went to Mary and apologized and told her that I hadn’t known that my hand and said that it was airtight. I felt bad and went and sat down ashamed.
