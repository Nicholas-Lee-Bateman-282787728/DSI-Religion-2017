Back in the Hospital, September

Pam is in seclusion, lying on a mattress on the hospital floor wrapped in a sheet spattered with drops of blood from the cuts on her forehead. Scribbled on the wall above her is her own graffiti: Kill me. I'm sorry. The Ogre that Ate Manhattan Must Die.

Carolyn comes in and sits down beside her. Pam, pale and irritable, peers out from under the sheet. "I apologize that I didn't have something sharper," Pam says, referring to the piece of plastic she used to cut herself. "I found the sharpest thing I could."

Recently, O'Malley agreed to let Pam replace the Zyprexa with another anti-psychotic. During that transition, her mind became sort of chemically stuck: catatonic. She was aware of what was happening around her, but could not speak and could move only with help.

The doctors considered electroshock to jolt her out of it, but Carolyn said no, fearing that it might affect Pam's memory. What's a memoir without a memory?

Eventually, medication brought Pam back, but voices are still telling her to kill herself. The doctors put Pam back on Zyprexa, but when she's released she goes off it again. Soon she's rehospitalized.
