AMELIA’S VISIT
[if !supportEmptyParas]   [endif]
It was in the fall, and someone knocked at the door. I looked outside before opening the door. Amelia stood there looking at me through teary eyes. She had come back. I opened the door and threw my arms around her, laughing and crying and kissing her. We went inside and she told me she had a surprise for me. She brought out a package from inside her coat wrapped in purple and gold paper, with a yellow ribbon tied around it. Inside the gift box were little dead flowers and autumn leaves. She said to look deeper. Farther in was a picture of Amelia, a baby girl, and me. I looked up with surprise Amelia was smiling.
She took my head in her hands and in her lovely earnest voice she told me that this was her baby, our baby, and that I should never ever forget that. She made me promise, and I did. Then she told me that for awhile I will forget, and putting her finger on my lips to keep me from speaking, she whispered, but someday, you will remember this, and I will return and be your wife, but for now, all we have is now. Then the phone rang, she answered it and said something, and then she stood up and put on her coat again. I begged her not to leave, and she said that she had to, and that she loved me. Then she was gone.

I never told any of the doctors who tried to help me about these visions, they were mine and I knew that the doctors would only try to say that this was not possible, which would only infuriate me more, so I never said anything.
