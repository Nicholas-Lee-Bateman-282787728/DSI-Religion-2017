The first symptoms
It was in a late summer of last century - I had finished my studies successfully and worked as a freshbaked graduate in a Berlin large-scale enterprise - then I got such an unpleasant feeling at the neck shortly above the collar-bone. I attributed it to the circulation and thought, I would have to do more sport. That were the aftereffects of the stress of the completion of thesis (diploma). That this the first signs of a coming nerve illness were, to it I in the dream would not have thought.
The following months I was strongly busy with the programming of a project for the department. Often I operated until late into the night. In springtime of the next our boss had decided to form a new computer specialist department. However, I wanted to remain in my department at that time, because of the nice colleagues. So I had been through very unpleasant personnel discussions, where a higher boss pressurized me strongly, in a very unrefined way. I remained in my position. A few days later I got pains in the heart area and in bed seemed it to me in such a way in the evening, as if this bad boss causes the heart stabbing by a remote control. I was strongly concerned and thought in this moment, he was the personified bad, the devil. On the next day I believed only in circulation problems and meant, I would have to do more sport. With the following forest run I had caught a cold then and was ill for two weeks. The heart aches eased.
I had the need in the next months to experience as much as possible. So I was often on the way alone in other environment. However, at the same time I was dissatisfied about a missing leisure rhythm. The fact that I had at the moment no girlfriend oppressed me anyway. So I sat after one week vacation with arduous bicycle tours in August in the train back to Berlin.
