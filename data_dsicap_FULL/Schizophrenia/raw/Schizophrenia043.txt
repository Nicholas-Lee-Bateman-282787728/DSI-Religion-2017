THE (live) RADIO
[if !supportEmptyParas]   [endif]
Inside the cassette player of the radio was a tape. It was unlabeled and I played it just to see what was on it. It was more piano playing. It was dad again. I listened to both sides and then turned on the radio. The first thing I heard was a DJ commenting on how weird it would be to be to find out that you had a baby ~ and that the mother and baby showed up knocking at your door. I turned off the radio, and sat excitedly to wait for Amelia to show up knocking. After a short while, I decided that it still wasn’t time for that yet, and turned on the radio again. The song was from AC/DC, a hard—rock band. I had heard the song many times before, but something was different. I listened more intently, and then I knew what the difference was, the music was slyly being played note-for note, the musicians were playing this music right now, just for me. I suddenly imagined this large studio with the bands lining up on a circle of stages, preparing sound—checks before being the next ones to play on the live broadcast. Other songs from other bands kept playing that I don’t remember now, but then a band played that had always been one of my favorites. The band was the Beatles, and John Lennon was singing the lead part, he was alive after all, and he was playing for me. Imagine that.
