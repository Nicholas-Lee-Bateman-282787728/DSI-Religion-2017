THE DREAM-MEN
[if !supportEmptyParas]   [endif]
I was lying on the floor in a house where I used to live, and was on pallet of blankets I used for a bed, (which was accurate, I had no bed then) and I awoke to find two men whispering and working to strap me inside some kind of trolley-stretcher. When I asked what they were doing, they both looked up startled, one of them reached over and touched something on my neck, and I slipped into sleep again. This is how they must have been able to move me to the design—centers without my memory of it. The dream—men transported me to the design—centers for weeks at a time, so that I could help solve difficult problems to help mankind, and then be returned to my regular life until the time came to bring me out of the coma.
