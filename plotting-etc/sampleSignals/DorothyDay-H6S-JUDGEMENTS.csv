no altar and no Church , and I wish to fling down the challenge at once , that what is the great disaster is that priests and laity alike have lost the concept of work , they have lost a philosophy of labor , as Peter Maurin has always said .', 'In the great clean shining factories , with good lights and air and the most sanitary conditions , an eight-hour day , five-day week , with the worker chained to the belt , to the machine , there is no opportunity for sinning as the outsider thinks of sin .', 'To be an efficient factory worker , one must become a hand , and the more efficient one is

walking on picket lines , they love the man in the dungarees and the blue or plaid shirt they write glowingly of his callused handsthey take these leaves from the communist notebookthey are glorifying the proletariat , the dispossessed , the propertyless , the homeless , and the workers can hang a holy medal on their machine or over their bunk in the focastle and pray as they begin and finish their work , and go home to their two-room or three-room apartment and surrounded by children and an exhausted wife , sanctify their surroundings or forget them in the nearest tavern with polluted beer , adulterated wine , or hard liquor .', 'The YCW comment at the end of Canon Cardijns pamphlet is this : The YCW shows the workers that whatever a mans state ( which after all is according to the dispensation of providence ) his primary struggle is against himself , and when that is well in hand the rest is largely a question of adapting himself to his surroundings , in order to get the very best out of them both spiritually and temporally .', 'In other words , accept the machine , accept the factory , the speed-up system , the work in which you are spentso spent indeed , that on coming out of the factory exhausted , though not physically ( the work is light , many say ) , one seeks the anodyne of drink or sex .', 'No , the immorality is not in the factory , so much , it is after it , a result of it .', 'For some months I lived in Farmingdale , Long Island , where there was a gigantic airplane factory where they were constructing bombers .', 'And vital statistics from Dr.Bakers figures from the Department of Agriculture , show that it is not only city life , but life in the factories that is cutting down the size of the family so that at present we are a middle-aged country .', 'Trash Should the worker sanctify his surroundings in the lumber camps where huge forests are being denuded all over the country , for profit .', 'Canon Cardijn is opposed to the materialism of the day , but most priests when they sensitively use the word materialism , rather than communism or red fascism , are meaning the same thing .', 'Temporary Lift Where Christ is present among the masses , in all their circumstances , conditions , modes of life , there Christian mysticism , which is union with Christ , takes on a deeper and more extensive reality .', 'But I deny that Christ is present in the factories , among the workers , that they take Him there The workers of the world are lost to the church .', 'It is a delusion , a deception , and once more the workers are being betrayed .', 'For a while they may be aroused to hope , they may lose themselves in meetings , in mass demonstrations , in pilgrimages to the Holy Father and filled with the afterglow of these glorious experiences warm their factories with them , but it will not be lasting .', 'The Popular Republican Movement of France , which has as part of its economic program nationalization or national control has elicited this comment from the Holy Father , in his letter to the Social Study Week held by French Catholics in Strasbourg recently : IT IS EVIDENT THAT INSTEAD OF ATTENUATING THE MECHANICAL NATURE OF LIFE AND LABOR IN COMMON , NATIONALIZATION , EVEN WHEN LICIT , THREATENS TO ACCENTUATE THESE STILL MORE , AND CONSEQUENTLY THE BENEFIT DERIVING FROM IT TO A TRUE COMMUNITY IS VERY MUCH OPEN TO QUESTION The Popes Words In 1939 , in an address to the International Congress of Catholic Womens League , the Holy Father said : In this age of mechanization the human person becomes

by the demagogue .', 'At present , as you know , the responsibility for using or not using machines is entirely that of men of business whose interests are , of course , simply in buying and selling and not in making , and therefore in a broad way it may be said that the first thing to be done ( first in the sense of most important ) is for the workers to recapture the control of industry .', 'For the rest , it should be obvious that some things are better made by machines than by hand .', 'For instance , it would be ridiculous to make typewriters except by mass production , otherwise they would be absolutely prohibitive in price , and the whole point of a typewriter is to save money and time .', 'Work done by man is human work to be valued and thought of as such and not merely as a cost in the account books .', 'Hence , it is that while both Communism and Christianity are moved by compassion for the multitude , the object of communism is to make the poor richer but the object of Christianity is to make the rich poor and the poor holy .', 'The hireling flieth , because he is a hireling , but this is not to say that the wage slave is a bad man but that he has not the

interests of big business , remember , within the next five years , according to the Department of Agriculture of the U. S. ) Holy Resistance Supernatural selfishness is in order here , and a hatred of such work that degrades and dehumanizes .', 'But I am in favor of the nonviolent techniques of the strike , the withdrawal of labor , violence will be inflicted , but let it not be on the part of the worker .', 'But they do regard the shedding of ones blood as so essential that I have seen the workers goading the police to bring about this violence so satisfying to man , who has not been taught the use of his spiritual weapons so that he may take heaven by violence , and make it more possible to praise and worship God here and now thus beginning ones heaven on earth to what extent it is possible .', 'Saints and Workers The basic ideal of family life is tomultiply the number of the elect .', 'Let this be brought home to the working classes , for they in particular are equal to the acts of generosity , devotion and self denial which such an ideal demands .', 'Philip Hagren has a biting and strong article in a recent issue of the CATHOLIC WORKER ( it had been printed in The Cross and the Plough ) and in it he wondered how priests would like it if there was subdivision of labor in offering up the Holy Mass , thousands of them reciting the Gloria , thousands reciting the Introibo ( but to be consistent we should break it down to one senseless syllable , rather than to a prayer or canticle ) .']"
