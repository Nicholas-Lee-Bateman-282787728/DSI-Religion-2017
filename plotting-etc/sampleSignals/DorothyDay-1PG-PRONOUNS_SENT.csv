.', 'Peter Maurin , the founder of the Catholic Worker movement , died in 1949 , May 15 , on the feast of St.John Baptist de La Salle , in whose order of Christian Brothers he had taught for five years as a young man in Paris .', 'He was preeminently a teacher , an agitator he liked to call himself , and he brought to us great books and great ideas , and great men , so that over the years , we have become a school for the service of God here and now .', 'As usual we went out into Union Square this May Day to distribute some two thousand copies of the paper and to meet with old friends with whom we can talk of philosophical differences , and with whom we are united in a passion for peace and justice Peters Book On this anniversary of Peters death we announce another edition of Peter Maurins Easy Essays , to be published by the Thistle Press which is also bringing out another one of the Fritz Eichenberg albums shortly ( There may be a few copies of the first one left ) .', 'This book will not only contain Peters essays in new format but also some essays about Peter written by his friends , including one editorial from Blackfriars about Peter as prophet .', 'When we listened to Abbe Pierre this month and his talk of the need for prophets , to bring to men in power the needs of the poor , to cry out unceasingly for justice , we thought of Peter .', 'As for the destitute , we can only reach them with love and the works of mercy , performed personally , at a sacrifice .', 'Our Temptation Because Peters program called for such practical things as houses of hospitality and farming communes or agronomic universities , we have often forgotten the first point in his program which was the need for clarification of thought , the need to clarify the theory of revolution .', 'But Peters was the green revolution , a call for a return to the villages and the land to make that kind of society where it is easier for men to be good .', 'Realizing that we had all too often leaped into the active work of trying to initiate these farming communes and agronomic universities , when our vocation was to write and speak and go out into the highways and byways , and that even the model society wasnt the first step in changing mens hearts towards each other , we started in 1940 a retreat house where all could come and make five days silent retreat to begin again the work of putting off the old man and putting on our Lord Jesus Christ .', 'With Him we could do all things , and without Him we could do nothing .', 'Our farms , Maryfarm and Peter Maurin farm , became once again houses of hospitality on the land as well as places where we could have retreats and days of recollection .', 'People who need hospitality and who are suffering in body mind and soul , are not the ones to be starting agronomic universities , even though God has always used the mean and lowly , the weak and powerless to do his work .', 'We will get the work initiated , that we know .', 'As it is now all over the country things are being done that never would have been done if there had been no Peter Maurin back in 1932 broadcasting his ideas through the new medium of the Catholic Worker .', 'Personalism , Anarchism , Libertarianism His whole message was that everything began with ones self .', 'He termed his message a personalist one , and was much averse to the word socialist , since it had always been associated with the idea of political action , the action of the city or the state .', 'He wanted us all to be what we wanted the other fellow to be .', 'If every man became poor there would not be any destitute , he said .', 'He wanted us all to quit passing the buck , and trying to pass on the work to George to do .', 'He loved using American slang , in his French peasant accent , which made it very funny , but it has kept his most popular essays from being appreciated in his native country , France .', 'Freedom Above all it was in the name of mans freedom that Peter opposed all government ownership of the indigent , as one Bishop put it .', 'Two Is make a we , he used to say , and we is a community and they is a crowd , a lonely crowd , he would have added if he had read Reismans book .', 'He wanted no organization , so The Catholic Worker groups have always been free associations of people who are working together to get out a paper , to run houses of hospitality for themselves and for others who come in off the road .', 'He had taken to himself that new constitution that new rule of the Sermon on the Mount , and truly loved his enemies and wanted to do good to all men , including those who injured him or tried to enslave him .', 'He literally believed in overcoming evil with good , hatred with love .', 'He loved the rich as well as the poor , and he wanted to make the rich envy the poor who were so close to Christ , and to try to become closer to them by giving of their means to start these schools , farming communes and agronomic universities .', 'Houses of hospitality are always run by the generosity of the poor who work in them and by the donations of the more comfortably off who send what they can to keep them going .', 'It is a pitiful thing to house priests in chicken coops even though they have the privacy of one room , in these converted shelters .', 'We Are All Greedy No , another one of our mistakes in the past is that we have wanted to be all things , to do all things and while we have learned by doing , we have also learned what we can not do .', 'We can agitate , we can initiate , we can arouse the conscience but we can not start a housing project for the destitute as Abbe Pierre has in Paris ; or a model village , or an agronomic university either .', 'Part of Abbe Pierres great wisdom is that he limited himself to that most important work of the day , sheltering the harborless , without question , with the love of his fellow poor .', 'He himself had gone out to sleep in the doorways , on the hard pavements , in order to give his bed to a destitute woman and child , and in reward for this folly of love , he had been enabled to arouse the people of France , so that in a brief year , more was accomplished than he had ever been able to accomplish by his seven years in the house of deputies in Paris .', 'How Peter would have loved his single mindedness , his purity of vision !', 'We have had many with us who could not find their vocation .', 'They want religious life and life in the world .', 'They want to have families and to preach , not teach .', 'They wanted so much , not recognizing it was God Himself they wanted , that they could not develop the talents God gave them , and wander year after year wondering what God wants them to do .', 'Peter would tell them , first of all , earn a living by the sweat of your own brow , not some one elses .', 'Choose a work that can be considered honorable , and can be classed under the heading of a work of mercy , serving your brothers , not exploiting them .', 'And by it he gains love too , because he serves his brother , and love is an exchange of gifts .', 'How often I have seen people begin to love each other , because they worked together .', 'He loved St.Benedict because he said that what the workers needed most was a philosophy of work .', 'He loved St.Francis because he said St.Francis , through his voluntary poverty , was free as a bird .', 'The sad news we have to tell is that Tom Sullivan is taking an indefinite leave of absence .', 'It was like Tom to wait until the death of Shorty before he made up his mind .', 'He had wanted to go , he said , for a year , but such human needs as Shortys kept him like iron chains .', 'The Lord does strange things with us .', 'Like Habbukuk we are plucked by the hair of the head and deposited here and there in the apostolate .', 'We had all thought that Tom , like Charlie ORourke , was with us for life .', 'Tom was with the Chicago house and Chicago Catholic Worker until the war , and after the war he came to the New York house where , aside from the interval of a yearhe went to Chicago for a wedding and didnt come backwhen he went to Loyola and worked for TODAY magazinehe has been with us since , writing for , and making upThe Catholic Worker each month , heading the house , having charge of the finances , and in general performing all the works of mercy .', 'Perhaps in a year , after a retreat , after a sabbatical year , he will be back .', 'It is whatever God wants .', 'Never mind , said Joe Motyka , who has been with us almost as long as Tom .', 'We got the paper out during the war , and well get it out again .', 'Anyone familiar with Joe can hear his hardboiled accents , as he said it , but they know too , the sadness in his heart and in John Pohls heart and the rest of the Chrystie street gang , at the absence of a friend']"
