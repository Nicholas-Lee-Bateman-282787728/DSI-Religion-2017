as an apostle to the world , not of the world .', u'In his poverty , rich ; in renouncing all , possessing all ; generous , giving out of his heart , sowing generously and reaping generously , humble and asking when in need , possessing freedom and all joy .', u'There are those who might say it comes because of his anarchistic nature , his refusal to enter into political controversy , his refusal to use worldly means to change the social order .', u'He has so thoroughly discouraged in his followers the use of political means that he has been termed an anarchist by many , especially by our dear Jesuit friend , Father Dowling , who often has often come to us and talked to us of proportional representation .', u'He uses those things he needs , in the way of clothing and food , as though he used them not .', u'He used to tell the late Father Virgil Michel that if Benedictines had kept to their early ideal of manual labor , there would not be so many breakdowns from mental over-work .', u'We must use the whole man , says Peter , so that we may be holy men .', u'He may be quoting it sounds like Eric Gill , but it also sounds like Peter .', u'There is nothing he likes better than building fires , and to get down and poke a grate fire until it is all but out , and poke kindling wood in under the coals , and shake it down , and finally dump it , and rebuild it altogether that is fun !', u'Then to laboriously go over the coal ( we have no sifters ) getting out the pieces so none will be wasted , and to empty the ashes and usually the wind blows them all over Peter , his grey hair , his iron grey suit and shoes .', u'There is not much in the way of manual labor he can do around Mott Street except to help keep the fires going and to mend chairs .', u'That is the way the voluntarily poor are treated , I tell Peter .', u'Because of our generosity in letting them borrow our chairs , because we believe that when someone takes our coat we should offer him our cloak too , then the argument is , they do not appreciate good things , they dont value what they have , so we might as well take them .', u'The poor dont know the difference , they say .', u'Peter does not answer , but takes the broken-down chairs , or those too heavy to be moved , which they have left us , and mends them uncomplainingly .', u'He begins , too , to understand what Christ meant when he said He came to minister , not to be ministered unto .', u'Saint Francis said , You can not know what you have not practiced .', u'It is voluntary poverty , stripping oneself even of what the world calls dignity , honor , human respect .', u'For truly it must be admitted that one does not always have the respect of the poor , of the workers .', u'There was Smitty who gave out clothes in the basement store room every day , and for three hours he took the abuse of the women and men who came for underwear and socks and sweaters and coats .', u'These clothes are sent in here for us .', u'He was in rags himself , down at the heel , wearing his clothes until we begged him to find something else in order to wash the things he had on .', u'He must drink he must steal it is beyond reason that anyone voluntarily should stay down in that dingy rat-ridden hole , under the five-story tenement and give out clothes and bits of literature , and keep on taking abuse as meekly as he did .', u'And already he had been up since five oclock in the morning , getting the coffee ready for the breadline , slicing the bread , which the men soak in their coffee .', u'They are served in one of the two stores which front our St.Josephs House of Hospitality .', u'The men must come in on a line , be served their coffee and bread at a counter , drink it and eat their soaked-up bread , and then go out and let another batch of thirty or so come in .', u'They can go back on the line again and take their turn on second helpings , and they can take all the bread they wish in their ragged pockets .', u'Many a time Peter makes what he calls points , but I do not understand for months .', u'Certainly through the fifty thousand readers of THE CATHOLIC WORKER ( that is its present circulation ) , he has found for himself many readers , many listeners .', u'Through the Houses of Hospitality which have been established , he has built up groups for round table discussions .', u'Through the farming communes , he has directed attention to fundamental economic ideas .', u'I do know thisthat when people come into contact with Peter Maurin , they change , they awaken , they begin to see , things become as new , they look at life in the light of the Gospels .', u'They admit the truth he possesses and lives by , and though they themselves fail to go the whole way their faces are turned at least toward the light .', u'Looking at things as he does in the light of history , taking the long view , he is content to play his part , to live by his principles and to wait .', u'I have always thought of Peter as an apostle to the world .', u'In the essays printed in THE CATHOLIC WORKER , many of them contain an outline of history , a criticism of history , an outline of simple solutions .', u'They all have to do with the world , this life which we know and love , with the needs of our bodies for food , clothing and shelter .', u'Richarz , he says , has summarized the evidence which proves that 30,000 years is the absolute minimum , and then he goes on to talk about early human remains of the Pleistocene period , which began from 300,000 to a million years ago , with the weight of opinion inclining more and more to the larger figure .', u'Thomas Mann , in the prelude to Joseph and His Brothers , says that experts estimate the age of the human species as 500,000 years , and calls it a scant reckoning .', u'With this fresh point of view , Peter does not find it at all extraordinary to expect people to try to begin now to put into practice some of the social ideas , not only of the New Testament , but of the old .', u'Unless we try to put these ideas into practice , we are guilty of secularism , so tersely condemned by Pope Pius XI .', u'Unless we are trying to put the social ideas of the Gospel into practice , we are not showing our love for our neighbor .', u'And how can we love God Whom we have not seen , unless we love our brother whom we do see , as Saint John wrote .', u'Unless we are putting these social ideas into practice , recognizing the correlation of the soul and body , we are using religion as an insurance policy , as a prop , as a comfort in affliction , and not only is religion then truly an opiate of the people , but we are like men who beholding our face in a glass , go away , not mindful of what manner of men we are .', u'He brings to us quotations and books and ideas that , by stimulating the mind to know , will encourage the heart to love .', u'Three quotations from the first letter of Saint John epitomize Peters religious attitude for me .', u'If we love one another , God abideth in us ; and His charity is perfected in us If any man say : I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar .', u'For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth , how can he love God whom he seeth not ?', u'And there is that sentence of Saint James , If a brother or sister be naked and want daily food , and one of you say to them , Go in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body , what shall it profit ?', u'It is the above quotations that point the reason for Peters preoccupation with the material details of this world , with the social order , with the need of rebuilding as he says , within the shell of the old , with a philosophy which is so old that it looks like new .', u'And this preoccupation of his with business , with economics , with agriculture , with labor , with capital , with credit unions , maternity guilds , with cooperatives , his unceasing emphasis on the fact that these are the vital concerns of religion , have led people to think of him as a materialist !', u'they say , piously , and return to their prayers .', u'After all , we must use our spiritual weapons , we must devote ourselves to religious service , and all these things will be added unto us .']"

I. Watkin , Christopher Dawson , G. K. Chesterton and Hillaire Belloc as well as E. J. Penty and Peter Kropotkin , who was in a way his favorite among the laywriters .', u'He always aimed at the best , and to him voluntary poverty , manual labor was the beginning of all true reform , which was to begin with ones self .', u'People are always saying , they dont do this , and they dont do that , he would cry out in ringing accents , WE is a community , THEY is a crowd .', u'And a lonely crowd , David Reisman would say , himself crying out against the damned wantlessness of the poor .', u'Peter would have liked Reismans book as he would have liked Martin Bubers book , PATHS IN UTOPIA .', u'He wanted people to be taught to want the best , and the best for him was the immediate program of the works of mercy , practiced in the cities and farming communes set up in the countryside where workers and scholars could get together to try to rebuild society within the shell of the old by founding better institutions to take the place of soulless corporations .', u'He saw the need for the works of mercy as a practice of love for our brother which was the great commandment and the only way we can show our love for Christ , and he saw too that such a practice would mean conflict with the State .', u'Peters teaching meant the immediate establishment of houses of hospitality because it was a time of depression and not only the worker , but young Catholic college graduates were unemployed .', u'Young people gave their services and unemployed workers gave their skills , and readers of THE CATHOLIC WORKER sent in material goods and money , so that for the last twenty years we have kept going on this basis of voluntary poverty and abolition of the wage system , for those preferred to give their services rather than go out and earn a wage for them .', u'Peter did not believe in the use of force to bring about this new society , so from the first we have opposed class war , race war , civil war , imperialist war , and have been surrounded by them all .', u'He spoke of the treason of the intellectuals and also of the fault of the worker who permitted his work to be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold .', u'The impact Peter made on us all , from one end of the country to the other , so that houses of hospitality and farms were undertaken from coast to coast , was because he personally lived a life of poverty and work .', u'The evil is so deep seated , he said , that of course much of the time will be given up to an immediate practice of the works of mercy .', u'But he believed too , in constantly trying to create order out of chaos .', u'Because Peter loved most of all what he called the green revolution , we are beginning our twenty-first year with emphasis on the land .']"
