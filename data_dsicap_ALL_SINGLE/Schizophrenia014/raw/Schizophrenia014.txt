HEY DIDDLE DIDDLE

My constant thoughts were beginning to focus more and more on my little girl. I had not seen her grow up. I had never told her that I loved her she only knew me by seeing me asleep in bed; .I began to try to remember nursery rhymes, and other things that I might need to know when I finally got to see her Out of the blue, I asked Randy if he could help me figure out the rest of the rhyme to hey diddle diddle. He got stuck when it came to the part about the little dog laughed. So did I. We started asking around the ward if anybody knew the rest of the rhyme. Nobody did. Finally, when I had given up hope to finding the rest of the words, old Mother Theresa came up to me with her walker. She whispered, “hey, diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon, the little dog laughed to see such a sight, and the dish ran away with the spoon.”
I thanked her gratefully and went back to my room to cry. I don’t know why I felt so moved by the rhyme, but I think it must have been because I felt so helpless that I had never been able to say the rhyme to my little eenfk1 I have always wanted to be a father, and now that I was, I couldn’t see his or her mother. This was probably the closest thing to suffering that the first episode would deal me. I had no idea at the time that the mental illness that afflicted me could deal out much worse suffering than this.
