DATA INPUT
[if !supportEmptyParas]   [endif]
Since I was living inside a cyber-world that was controlled by laboratories, whenever I received new ideas, the scientists were entering much-needed messages in the form of movie—clips of things that I didn’t know, into my memory. (Although these were only delusional “retracing” from desperately needing to believe my own ideas) The next two data inputs were the only ones that followed after the first one about when I found the head in the trashcan. (During that one I didn’t know that it was from the dream—men.) The following two movies—clips were the only remaining that I had during the first episode, but during the second and most traumatic episode, these data—inputs became constant.
