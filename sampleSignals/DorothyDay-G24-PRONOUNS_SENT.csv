and more to the larger figure .', 'Thomas Mann , in the prelude to Joseph and His Brothers , says that experts estimate the age of the human species as 500,000 years , and calls it a scant reckoning

be ye warmed and filled ; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body , what shall it profit ?', 'It is the above quotations that point the reason for Peters preoccupation with the material details of this world , with the social order , with the need of rebuilding as he says , within the shell of the old , with a philosophy which is so old that it looks like new .', 'And this preoccupation of his with business , with economics , with agriculture , with labor , with capital , with credit unions , maternity guilds , with cooperatives , his unceasing emphasis on the fact that these are the vital concerns of religion , have led people to think of him as a materialist !', 'they say , piously , and return to their prayers .', 'After all , we must use our spiritual weapons ,
