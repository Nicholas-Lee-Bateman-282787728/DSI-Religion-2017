Geoghegan , The Attitude Towards Labor In Early Christianity and Ancient Culture .', u'Unfortunately this thesis is out of print , but I had the opportunity to go through it and certainly feel that it is a book that should be made available to the layman .', u'It reminded me of a volume entitled The Ancient Lowly which I picked up in a secondhand store some years ago by a Socialist who wrote about the history of labor from the earliest times and whose thesis was that they were the exploited and the dispossessed and that his job was to contribute to their enlightenment and class-war consciousness .', u'In the whole study of labor and of work there is usually an acceptance of our capitalistic industrial system and the acceptance of the machine as the means to do away with human labor .', u'But here is a book by Father Song which is of exceptional interest to all in the lay apostolate which has more than a philosophy of labor ; it has a theology of labor .', u'He says In the Introduction the crux of the question of manual labor in St.Benedicts rule lies in that variously interpreted passage , If , however , the needs of the place require them to labor in gathering the harvest , let them not grieve at that , for then they are truly monks when they live by the labor of their hands as our fathers and the apostle did .', u'Peter Maurins idea for our farming communes was that there should be four hours of manual labor a day .', u'Father Sorgs treatise goes back to St.Anthony of Egypt who rejoiced in never having been troublesome to anyone else on account of labor of his hands .', u'His rule states : When you taught us that manual labor 1s necessary , it remaineth that we be taught the kind that suits our profession .', u'It is out of the question to speak of charity in a man that does not try to support himself , any more than to think of Christian faith in a father who even though he attempt some noble missionary enterprise In the Church , neglects to feed his own children .', u'St.Paul would say of him that he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel .', u'Own Burdens With the usual paradox that we find over and over again in the New Testament , we are told to bear our own burdens in Gal .', u'6,5 and then later on , we are told to bear one anothers burdens .', u'Consistently throughout the New Testament we hear the injunction not to judge , if we do not wish to be judged , so that when we read these things , it is to take them to ourselves , to work ourselves , to feed our own bodies and souls , and with whatever we have left , feed others .', u'For the one time that St.Paul says if a man will not work , neither let him eat , the entire New Testament , the sayings of our Lord , incline us toward tender kindness towards our fellows and an aversion to judging .', u'We have suffered much in the Catholic Worker movement from all the people who come and look at the men on our bread lines ( and we are feeding 500 a day in both Detroit and New York right now ) and say , Are you not contributing to the delinquency of these men by feeding them ?', u'and the reply being given , they are hoboes , and he wanted to know if there were not any Mama hoboes .', u'song that deals with this situation is that famous one Halleluia , Im a Bum and one of the verses runs : Why dont you work like other men do ?', u'The workers as a mass have lost a philosophy of labor , as Peter says and they have lost a philosophy of poverty .', u'It breaks our hearts here at the Catholic Worker to see these lines of men who need work as much as they need bread and we do not have the work to give them .', u'We have farms , it is true , but you can not cultivate the earth or build shelters for the workers without skills , tools and materials , and God has seen fit to keep usIn such poverty that we are not able to provide these .', u'The miracle of the loaves and fishes is repeated over and over again so that we could almost say We can do all things in Him who strengthens us .', u'Certainly by ourselves we could never have kept going with the cost of food going up 40 % .', u'Somehow or other just enough comes in , just enough to keep going , through the almsgiving of the faithful and through the fact that everyone works in the movement without salary and is pledged to voluntary poverty , to the greater or less degree that they can take it .', u'Nowhere have I seen love so in flower , nowhere such quick compassion or hospitality so eager , says St.Rufinus .', u'one gets the impression that the Holy Spirit abounded in that country like fire in a dry woods and that society in that region was pregnant with Christ and that you could almost live on love alone .', u'Poverty coupled with manual labor is charitys twin sister and inseparable companion , and he even goes on to say that people who do intellectual labor and who go in for artificial physical exercise as a substitute for human natures ontological need for manual work have also a substitute chastity .', u'He goes in also for a deeper theology of manual labor In dealing with man as co-creator with God : taking the raw materials that God has provided , making things of use and of beauty and thus bringing about in his life that synthesis of cult , culture and cultivation that Peter Maurin used to talk so much about .', u'I could write much more on this whole subject but I am sure that what I have written will induce our friends to write to Father Sorg and get this very inspiring booklet .']"
