in a character defect of the offending party .', 'All of us , I hope , can recall an instance when we have been on the receiving end of the sting of a **CODEC_ERROR** hurt , but rather than counter with our own anger , we have found ourselves feeling sorry for the other person .', 'We realize that a **CODEC_ERROR** condition , no matter what its toll may be on us , is actually far sadder and more enduring for them .', 'Sometimes , our anger actually turns to compassion for that person , or for that **CODEC_ERROR** family , who has to deal with that flawed individual every day .', 'Our hurt , inevitably , will fade , but that person will remain trapped in his or her condition long after we have left the room .', 'It happens to me as a rabbi not infrequently .', 'I am called into a family situation **CODEC_ERROR** there has been an unspeakable loss **CODEC_ERROR** and the aggrieved , understandably , believe the world and God to be unfair .', 'I may not even have known the family until I walked into the room , but in that moment , a man or woman of the cloth becomes a target for all sorts of hostility .', 'All of which means , that if you want to last more than a week in the rabbinate , you need to learn very quickly how to say to yourself , **CODEC_ERROR** **CODEC_ERROR** about me .', 'This is not personal and I am not , under any circumstances , taking the bait .', 'God knows **CODEC_ERROR** the things these people are saying , compared to the hurt they are feeling **CODEC_ERROR** how very lucky I am to be able to go home and tuck my kids in at **CODEC_ERROR** And yes , if I could bottle whatever it is that enables one to redirect hurt away from **CODEC_ERROR** ego and leverage it into compassion , believe you me , I would .', 'Probably the closest our tradition comes to recognizing this task is in this **CODEC_ERROR** parashah , with the introduction of the Nazirite , an individual who , by way of self-imposed vows , acquires an elevated plane of spiritual existence .', 'If the very goal of the Nazirite regimen was to subdue the self in order to be raised up to a transcendent spiritual plane , then it is precisely by this criterion that the anti-hero of our haftorah , Samson , misses the mark .', '**CODEC_ERROR** personality may have been larger than life , but the narcissism that led to his downfall touches close to home , his superhuman fall altogether akin to our own flawed humanity .', 'Like Samson , our egos are still in need of a Copernican revolution , a realization that no one of us sits at the center of the universe .', 'It is so easy to walk around in this world believing that your hurt must be the result of malice and ill will .', 'How could it be otherwise if I believe everything is about me ?', 'A good first step towards spiritual rehabilitation is to forgo the unhealthy insistence that we are the lead actors of the narratives in which we live .', 'We are all bit players , supporting players in a script much bigger than any one of us .', 'Not unlike what some eastern religions counsel , and in the same way as the biblical Nazirite , we subvert our egos from being all-consuming .', 'It goes by many names , in many languages , but the easiest way to describe it may be by using a word we all knew before we walked into this sanctuary today , and that word is **CODEC_ERROR** It is in this maturity that we become more attuned to the things in life that really matter .', 'It is not all about me , not everything needs to be taken personally , not every hurt is worthy of our attention , and not every wrong is in need of being righted .', 'According to tradition , the darkest moment of our **CODEC_ERROR** history , the destruction of the Temple , resulted from causeless hatred **CODEC_ERROR** in Hebrew , sinat hinam .', 'Shamed , Bar Kamsa sought revenge against the rabbis who sat idly by as he was embarrassed , and went on to engineer a complex vendetta that ultimately led to the Roman destruction of the Temple .', 'How striking that at the root of this story describing the start of our **CODEC_ERROR** two-thousand-year exile was the causeless hatred of individuals unable to overcome the narcissism of turning every injury into a personal affront .', 'How different our history would be if these individuals had been able to put aside their egos and attend to the things that really matter .', 'Given such a telling of our **CODEC_ERROR** history , we can understand why some two thousand years later , the first chief rabbi of Palestine , Rav Kook , explained that if the Temple was destroyed due to causeless hatred/sinat hinam , its rebuilding can only come by way of ahavat hinam/causeless love .', '( Orot Hakodesh III ) It is a big ask **CODEC_ERROR** I know .', 'But perhaps this Shabbat , we can begin with those of us in this room , or maybe just ourselves **CODEC_ERROR** to allow for the possibility that it is not always about me , to lessen our egos and thereby enlarge our hearts .', 'In doing so , perhaps we can bring this world one small step closer towards redemption .']"
