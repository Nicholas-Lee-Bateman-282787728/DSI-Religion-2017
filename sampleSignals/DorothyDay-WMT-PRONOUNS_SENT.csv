Oregon , is feeding almost two thousand men a day now , according to a priest who just visited us from there .', 'Once I asked Peter what he thought of our Baltimore House ( which was finally closed not only because of overcrowding but also because we housed both Negro and white ) and he looked rather doubtful , thinking of what he really wanted in a house , craftrooms , seminars , reading rooms , as well as a place to eat and sleep .', 'He always firmly held that the works of mercy were the means to show our love for God and our love for our brother .', 'It was the men in the house themselves that started our breadlines , by taking in one after another to share our meals .', 'It seems we never do anything good by ourselves , we just get pushed into it .', 'We are surely unprofitable servants .', 'One time at Maryfarm I saw a man with a suitcase walking down the road towards our farmhouse , and since we were already filled to the door , and with problems too , I sighed deeply and remarked , I suppose he is coming here .', 'And a man sitting next to me said sternly , Then you dont mean what you write in the paper ?', 'Yes , we believe it .', 'And he was talking to each one of us , not to Holy Mother the State .', 'Of course there are some ideas which we change over the years .', 'Personally I dont believe women should work out of the home if they can possibly help it .', 'But we do not have a philosophy of work , as Peter Maurin said , and certainly the jobs open to most people in this mechanized age , are anything but attractive .', 'Steve Hergenhan , God rest his soul , used to call me a pencil pusher when I did my writing and he dearly loved to see me in the kitchen working .', 'There is always a war between worker and scholar and too often the scholar has it coming to him .', 'Im afraid I believe in private property too , though St.Gertrude says that property , the more common it is , the more holy it is .', 'Of course if one is deprived of these things , one should thank the one who deprives , since they are lightening ones load on the journey to heaven .', 'Once a policeman called up and said he had picked up a man who was bringing one of our typewriters to a Bowery hock shop .', 'The man explained that all property was held in common around the Catholic Worker , so it was his as well as any one elses .', 'The policeman restored our property .', 'We didnt press charges of course , and we thanked the policeman .', 'He hangs on to his own pencil , book , clothes , so carefully indeed that we sometimes call him private-property-Hennacy .', 'Once a passerby dropped into our store at Mott street when Slim was being night watchman , and someone had brought us a turkey that night since it was the eve of Thanksgiving .', 'Slim wanted to take a little walk , so he left the stranger in charge and went out .', 'There was a great furor around the house , but we took the opportunity to explain that in the upside-down world of Christianity , Slim should have run after the thief and brought him the cranberries and celery and other fixings so that he could have a really good meal .', 'If anyone takes your coat , give him your cloak too .', 'I have told this story before , but I did not tell the sequel .', 'Sometimes perhaps we arouse a little fear in the hearts of our friends .', 'We expressed ourselves in the CW as pleased with this expropriation , and went on to say that the Benedictine oblates amongst us would like to go to some of the Benedictine monasteries and become squatters on their vast tracts , and so induce them to start again the guest houses which are part of the rule of the order .', 'They dont need all the land they have , and we have plenty of landless folk .', 'Not long after that , ( but we had forgotten our comments , thinking of them as casual illustrations of our point rather than plans for action ) we went to visit a Benedictine monastery , Peter , Dwight Larrowe and I .', '( Dwight is now Brother Peter in the Trappist Monastery of Our Lady of the Snows in Colorado . )', 'We were fed a very good dinner rather hastily , and then the good monks pulled out bus schedules and rather hastily found a way of getting us off their premises .', 'I thought the visit very short , there had been no time for any conversation , nor any dear-to-his-heart round table discussions for Peter , but it was only on the way home that it occurred to me that our dear friends the monks had read the paper and had been afraid that in the parlance of the gangster , we were casing the joint .', 'In other words , that we were sizing up the place with the end in view of moving in some of our unemployed families .', 'Well , if they suffered from this misconception , we were made to suffer too .', 'That month we had had a letter from one of our friends who was married and had two children and was dissatisfied with the farm his father had given for his use .', 'He wanted to join one of our farm communities .', 'We wrote and told him that he already had a home and that we were forced to say no .', 'But he disregarded us and very soon after car and trailer arrived and little family with another baby imminent , to move into our barn .', 'We did not want them , but they were there ; it was as though God were teaching us a lesson , was having a little joke on us , making us eat our words .', 'There are so many stories that could be told about our communities , our houses of hospitality , and some of them grim and some of them so funny and so good that one could laugh for joy .', 'I used to say the same of Peter , of course , thinking of my quiet writing life before I met him in 1932 and became embroiled in what became a movement .', 'But they needed more time to get acquainted .', 'These guerrilla warfare tactics - descending on a town with pickets and leaflets and poster walks and radio talks and so on , may cause surprise and some thought but I liked the way things worked out in Phoenix , Arizona , where little by little Ammon got acquainted with all the priests and sisters in the town , and won their friendship and won , too , a very wide circulation for the idea of the Catholic Worker .', 'It is Ammons recognition of course , that we are living in fearsome times and that only the most drastic , heroic remedies , much suffering , and self-inflicted sufferings , are going to serve as penance for our sins as a country .', 'We do indeed need to fast and pray .', 'They use to say of Peter that he held up to us such lofty aims that we could only reach half way .', 'And that if his aims were lower , we would still only be reaching half way , human nature being inclined to sloth .', 'His actions are always better than his words , when it comes to living his faith , putting in hours serving others , getting mail , answering it , giving up his bed , listening to the sick , the poor and afflicted .', 'Yes , we will stand by him .', 'Picketing And how he delights to call attention to the fact that we once picketed the Cardinal during the cemetery strike .', 'It has gotten now so that some of the people at the CW deny that we ever did .', 'The facts are that Michael Kovalak , Irene Mary Naughton and Helen Adler took signs and when all others were fearful of criticism , proceeded to the chancery office and after announcing their intentions to one of the priests at the cathedral , who told them they of course had to follow their conscience , thereupon picketed for an hour and then went into the cathedral and prayed , to make their picketing more effective .', 'It was so effective that Ammon Hennacy , not yet a Catholic , in far away Arizona , went into the Catholic Church for the first time and prayed joyfully for us all , and thanked God for companions of courage .', 'Some time later , on another visit to the Church he said he began to be conscious that those praying , kneeling Catholics , no matter what their political opinions , had something .', 'And not to be outdone , now he has it too .', 'On my last trip when I passed out some Catholic Worker papers in the bus which came from Mexico City to El Paso ( fare eleven dollars ) the insurance saleswoman who was reading the paper began to read Peters essays out loud to her companion , a Canadian , and to laugh with startled amazement at his ideas .', 'because I feel that though they themselves do not feel they need to be interpreted , translated , explained , or justified - I am doing it to declare my own position .', 'Sometimes some of our readers like to hold that I , Dorothy Day , editor of the Catholic Workers , do not go along with these ideas , - that others have seized control of the paper , that these ideas are somehow not in line with the works of mercy .', 'Peter used to say that it was men who had the mission and that it was womans place to follow the men who follow their mission .', 'And there are others still with us , too numerous to mention , Hank and John and Keith , and Larry and Roy and Joe , and Red and John and Jim , and Pop and Tom and Mike , and then the men on the farm
